10.5061/dryad.fm67n,open,Data from: IM-TORNADO: a tool for comparison of 16S reads from paired-end libraries,"Motivation: 16S rDNA hypervariable tag sequencing has become the de facto method for accessing microbial diversity. Illumina paired-end sequencing, which produces two separate reads for each DNA fragment, has become the platform of choice for this application. However, when the two reads do not overlap, existing computational pipelines analyze data from read separately and underutilize the information contained in the paired-end reads. Results: We created a workflow known as Illinois Mayo Taxon Organization from RNA Dataset Operations (IM-TORNADO) for processing non-overlapping reads while retaining maximal information content. Using synthetic mock datasets, we show that the use of both reads produced answers with greater correlation to those from full length 16S rDNA when looking at taxonomy, phylogeny, and beta-diversity. Availability and Implementation: IM-TORNADO is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/imtornado and produces BIOM format output for cross compatibility with other pipelines such as QIIME, mothur, and phyloseq."
10.5061/dryad.h373j,open,Data from: Recognizing false positives: synthetic oligonucleotide controls for environmental DNA surveillance,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used for surveillance and detection of species of interest in aquatic and soil samples.  A significant risk associated with eDNA methods is potential false positive results due to laboratory contamination.  To minimize and quantify this risk, we designed and validated a set of synthetic oligonucleotides for use as species-specific positive PCR controls for several high-profile aquatic invasive species.  The controls consist of species-specific sequences for the species of interest, with the addition of a synthetic insert containing recognition sites for several restriction enzymes.  Following PCR, the presence of the synthetic insert can be detected using gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digests, or DNA sequencing. For quantitative PCR (qPCR), false positives in environmental samples can also be detected using a fluorescent probe designed to detect the synthetic insert.  The generation of synthetic controls is a cost-effective, reproducible method that increases the power and reliability of eDNA testing by eliminating misinterpretation of false positive results from laboratory contamination."

10.5281/zenodo.5673924,open,Synthetic time series data generation for edge analytics,"<p>In this research, we create synthetic data with features that are like data from IoT devices. We use an existing air quality dataset that includes temperature and gas sensor measurements. This real-time dataset includes component values for the Air Quality Index (AQI) and ppm concentrations for various polluting gas concentrations. We build a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) model to capture the distribution of variables and structure of this real dataset to generate the synthetic data. Based on the synthetic dataset and original dataset, we create a comparative predictive model. Analysis of synthetic dataset predictive model shows that it can be successfully used for edge analytics purposes, replacing real-world datasets. There is no significant difference between the real-world dataset compared the synthetic dataset. The generated synthetic data requires no modification to suit the edge computing requirements. The framework can generate correct synthetic datasets based on JSON schema attributes. The accuracy, precision, and recall values for the real and synthetic datasets indicate that the logistic regression model is capable of successfully classifying data</p>"

The corrosion inhibition mechanism of PPAPO with Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> was interpreted from the point of view of the thermodynamic. The results indicated that PPAPO with Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> acted as a mixed type inhibitor. The inhibition film formed on N80 steel surface can increase the charge transfer resistance and prevent the occurrence of corrosion reaction, thereby reducing the corrosion rate of metal surface. The inhibition efficiency was up to 99.65%; and the inhibitor PPAPO with Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> showed good synergistic effect on N80 corrosion behavior in HCl solution. The adsorption behavior of inhibitors on N80 steel surface was in accordance with the Langmuir adsorption model, and mainly belonged to chemisorption. The adsorption process of PPAPO on N80 surface was spontaneous and irreversible endothermic reaction.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.5533864,open,Primary data,"<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Electron-deficient olefin (EDO) ligands are known to promote a variety of nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, presumably by accelerating the reductive elimination step and preventing undesired &beta;-hydride elimination. While there is a growing body of experimental and computational evidence elucidating the beneficial effects of EDO ligands, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying coordination chemistry of the Ni&ndash;EDO species involved. In particular, most procedures rely on in situ assembly of the active catalyst, and there is a paucity of preligated Ni&ndash;EDO precatalysts. Herein, we investigate the 16-electron, heteroleptic nickel complex, Ni(COD)(DMFU), and examine the performance of this complex as a precatalyst in 1,2-diarylation of alkenes.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.4qrfj6q6d,open,Data from: Cell death and survival due to cytotoxic exposure modeled as a two-state Ising system,"<p>Cancer chemotherapy agents are assessed for their therapeutic utility primarily by their ability to cause apoptosis of cancer cells and their potency is given by an IC50 value. Chemotherapy uses both target-specific and systemic-action drugs and drug combinations to treat cancer. It is important to judiciously choose a drug type, its dosage, and schedule for optimized drug selection and administration. Consequently, the precise mathematical formulation of cancer cells response to chemotherapy may assist in the selection process. In this paper, we propose a mathematical description of the cancer cell response to chemotherapeutic agent exposure based on a time-tested physical model of two-state multiple-component systems near criticality. We describe the Ising model methodology and apply it to a diverse panel of cytotoxic drugs administered against numerous cancer cell lines in a dose-response manner. The analyzed dataset was generated by the Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V.(Oncolines). This approach allows for an accurate and consistent analysis of cytotoxic agents' effects on cancer cell lines and reveals the presence or absence of the bystander effect through the interaction constant. By calculating the susceptibility function, we see the value of IC50 coinciding with the peak of this measure of the system's sensitivity to external perturbations.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.784vv04,open,"Data from: Synchronous fluorescence as a green and selective tool for simultaneous determination of bambuterol and its main degradation product, terbutaline","A green, sensitive and cost-effective method is introduced in this research for the determination of bambuterol and its main degradation product; terbutaline simultaneously relied on the synchronous spectrofluorimetric technique. First derivative synchronous spectrofluorimetric amplitude is measured at Δλ=20 nm, so bambuterol can be quantitated at 260 nm, and terbutaline can be measured at 290 nm, each at the zero crossing point of the other. The amplitude-concentration plots were linear over the concentration ranges of 0.2-6.0 g/mL and 0.2-4.0 g/mL for both bambuterol and terbutaline, respectively. Official guidelines were followed to calculate the validation parameters of the proposed method. The low values of LODs 0.023, 0.056 g/mL and LOQs 0.071, 0.169 g/mL for bambuterol and terbutaline, respectively point out to the sensitivity of the method. Bambuterol is a prodrug for terbutaline, and the latter is considered its degradation product so the established method could be regarded as a stability-indicating one.  Moreover, the proposed method is utilized for the analysis of BAM and TEB in their single ingredient preparations and the results revealed statistical agreement with the reference method. The suggested method, being simple and low cost procedure, is superior to the previously published methods which need more sophisticated techniques, longer analysis time and highly toxic solvents and reagents. It could be considered as an ecofriendly analytical procedure."

One organism of particular concern is the blue crab, <i>Callinectes sapidus</i>, whose feeding strategies increase their likelihood of exposure to plastic pollution. To assess microplastic contamination in blue crabs, 39 individuals were collected from Corpus Christi Bay, TX and processed using a hydrogen-peroxide based tissue destruction method followed by confirmation using micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (µ-FTIR). From the 39 blue crabs sampled, 28 fully synthetic fragments and fibers and 24 semi-synthetic fibers were found within their stomachs. After correcting for possible contamination, 36% of collected blue crabs were estimated to contain 20 synthetic fragments and fibers and 14 semi-synthetic fibers (0.87 items crab<sup>-1</sup>). This study shows that blue crabs ingest microplastic items in Corpus Christi, TX and populations in other locations likely face similar risks.</p>"

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Drones will play an essential role in human-machine teaming in future search and rescue (SAR) missions. We present a first prototype that finds people fully autonomously in densely occluded forests. In the course of 17 field experiments conducted over various forest types and under different flying conditions, our drone found 38 out of 42 hidden persons; average precision was 86% for predefined flight paths, while adaptive path planning (where potential findings are double-checked) increased confidence by 15%. Image processing, classification, and dynamic flight-path adaptation are computed on-board in real time and while flying. Our finding that deep-learning-based person classification is unaffected by sparse and error-prone sampling within one-dimensional synthetic apertures allows flights to be shortened and reduces recording requirements to one tenth of the number of images needed for sampling using two-dimensional synthetic apertures. The goal of our adaptive path planning is to find people as reliably and quickly as possible, which is essential in time-critical applications, such as SAR. Our drone enables SAR operations in remote areas without stable network coverage, as it transmits to the rescue team only classification results that indicate detections and can thus operate with intermittent minimal-bandwidth connections (e.g., by satellite). Once received, these results can be visually enhanced for interpretation on remote mobile devices.</p>"

<p>Abstract: We show that automated person detection under occlusion conditions can be significantly improved by combining multi-perspective images before classification. Here, we employed image integration by Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS)---a synthetic aperture imaging technique that uses camera drones to capture unstructured thermal light fields---to achieve this with a recall of 93%. Finding lost or injured people in dense forests is not generally feasible with thermal recordings, but becomes practical with use of AOS integral images. Our findings lay the foundation for effective future search and rescue technologies that can be applied in combination with autonomous or manned aircraft.<br>

<strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Synthetic noisy urban soundscapes (SNUSS) is a dataset of synthetic soundscapes with real urban background noise meant to mimic urban soundscapes. This dataset contains 30,000 10 second mixtures, their isolated components, and auto-generated annotations. This dataset was developed with the goal of synthesizing soundscapes with a diverse set of realistic sounding background activity, for use in developing and evaluating machine listening systems in urban settings.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Mixture generation</strong></p>

<p>We generate synthetic mixtures using a collection of isolated sound events with class annotations, as well as a collection of urban background noise.&nbsp; Audio mixtures are 4 seconds long (at 16kHz). We generate a foreground sub-mixture using a subset of clips from <a href=""https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html"">UrbanSound8K</a> [3] from the <em>car horn</em>, <em>dog bark</em>, <em>gun shot</em>, <em>jackhammer</em> and <em>siren</em> classes. These clips range from 0.5 s to 4s. The number of events per mixture is sampled from a zero-truncated Poisson distribution with a rate parameter of 5. The class for each event is chosen uniformly at random from the five target classes. The particular sound event is chosen uniformly at random from the available clips for that class. The start time is chosen uniformly throughout the clip such that the entire clip is contained in the 4 second mixture. A brief fade-in and fade-out is applied to the clip to avoid discontinuities. Each clip is set to a sound level sampled uniformly at random in the range -30 to -20 dB LUFS.</p>

<p>For the background audio, we use urban background recordings from the SONYC-Background dataset [2, 4], containing 441 10 second recordings of urban background noise in New York City. For more information, see the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5129078"">SONYC-Backgrounds page</a>. For each mixture, a random background clip is chosen from which we extract a uniformly chosen 4 second segment.</p>

<p>We create datasets using an foreground-to-background SNRs of -50, -20 -0 dB LUFS, (`n50dB`, `n20dB`, and `0dB` respectively), in addition to a noiseless dataset (`none`). The datasets are generated such that the only difference between them is the relative loudness between the foreground and background.</p>

<p>For the training set, we generate 20,000 mixtures using folds 1-6 of UrbanSound8K and the training set of SONYC-Background. For the validation set, we generate 5,000 examples using folds 7-8 of UrbanSound8K and the validation set of SONYC-Background. For the test set, we generate 5,000 examples using folds 9-10 of UrbanSound8K and the test set of SONYC-Background.</p>

<p>For additional details on the foreground mixture generation process, please refer to [1]. For additional details on generating the soundscapes with background, please refer to [2].</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Files</strong></p>

<p>The dataset files are split into the following compressed archives:</p>

<ul>
	<li>`synthetic-noisy-urban-soundscapes_mixtures-bkgr-none.tar.gz` - Noiseless mixtures</li>
	<li>`synthetic-noisy-urban-soundscapes_mixtures-bkgr-n50dB.tar.gz` - Mixtures with -50 dB LUFS SNR</li>
	<li>`synthetic-noisy-urban-soundscapes_mixtures-bkgr-n20dB.tar.gz` - Mixtures with -20 dB LUFS SNR</li>
	<li>`synthetic-noisy-urban-soundscapes_mixtures-bkgr-0dB.tar.gz` - Mixtures with 0 dB LUFS SNR</li>
	<li>`synthetic-noisy-urban-soundscapes_isolated_events.tar.gz` - Isolated sound events for each mixture</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<em>Preparing the files</em></p>

<ol>
	<li>Download each of the tar.gz files to a new folder. You need at the `isolated_events` and one of the mixture datasets.</li>
	<li>Decompress all of the tar.gz files.</li>
	<li>Merge the contents of the extracted `isolated_events` folder into the extracted mixture folders. This makes sure the corresponding isolated events for each mixture are placed in its `XXXXX_events` folder.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>
<em>File structure</em></p>

<p>The mixture dataset folder for the desired background condition should have the format `synthetic-noisy-urban-soundscapes_mixtures-bkgr-&lt;condition&gt;/&lt;split&gt;`. Within each split folder are the mixture files, which are identified by an integer (padded with leading zeros up to 5 places). For a mixture `00001`, the mixture audio is `00001.wav` and the annotation file (in JAMS [5] format) is `00001.jams`. The isolated events can be found in the `00001_events` folder, where foreground events have the format `foreground&lt;fg-event-num&gt;_&lt;class-name&gt;.wav` and the background recording (if used) is called `background0_2017.wav`.</p>

10.5061/dryad.53b6n5f,open,Data from: Construction and characterization of synthetic bacterial community for experimental ecology and evolution,"Experimental microbial ecology and evolution have yielded foundational insights into ecological and evolutionary processes using simple microcosm setups and phenotypic assays with one- or two-species model systems. The fields are now increasingly incorporating more complex systems and exploration of the molecular basis of observations. For this purpose, simplified, manageable and well-defined multispecies model systems are required that can be easily investigated using culturing and high-throughput sequencing approaches, bridging the gap between simpler and more complex synthetic or natural systems. Here we address this need by constructing a completely synthetic 33 bacterial strain community that can be cultured in simple laboratory conditions. We provide whole-genome data for all the strains as well as metadata about genomic features and phenotypic traits that allow resolving individual strains by amplicon sequencing and facilitate a variety of envisioned mechanistic studies. We further show that a large proportion of the strains exhibit coexistence in co-culture over serial transfer for 48 days in the absence of any experimental manipulation to maintain diversity. The constructed bacterial community can be a valuable resource in future experimental work."

10.5281/zenodo.5567209,open,VAROS Synthetic Underwater Data Set,"<p>Underwater visual perception requires being able to deal with bad and rapidly varying illumination and with reduced visibility due to water turbidity. The verification of such algorithms is crucial for safe and efficient underwater exploration and intervention operations. Ground truth data play an important role in evaluating vision algorithms. However, obtaining ground truth from real underwater environments is in general very hard, if possible at all. In a synthetic underwater 3D environment, however, (nearly) all parameters are known and controllable, and ground truth data can be absolutely accurate in terms of geometry. In this paper, we present the VAROS environment, our approach to generating highly realistic underwater video and auxiliary sensor data with precise ground truth, built around the Blender modeling and rendering environment. VAROS allows for physically realistic motion of the simulated underwater (UW) vehicle including moving illumination. Pose sequences are created by first defining way-points for the simulated underwater vehicle which are expanded into a smooth vehicle course sampled at IMU data rate (200Hz). This expansion uses a vehicle dynamics model and a discrete-time controller algorithm that simulates the sequential following of the way-points. The scenes are rendered using the raytracing method, which generates realistic images, integrating direct light, and indirect volumetric scattering. The VAROS dataset version 1 provides images, inertial measurement unit (IMU) and depth gauge data, as well as ground truth poses, depth images and surface normal images.</p>"

10.5281/zenodo.5465253,open,Synthetic soil temperature time-series,"<p>The synthetic experiments are implemented to investigate the impact of different environmental conditions on the uncertainty of thermal diffusivity estimates. We generate synthetic temperature fields that represent various types of temperature gradients and fluctuations. This is achieved through forward modeling (i.e., heat-conduction process in a heterogeneous medium using an explicit finite difference method) with initial, top, and bottom boundary conditions set equal to the temperature time series observed at a monitoring site in Alaska during summer (synthetic_data_summer.csv ) and autumn (synthetic_data_autumn.csv ), and by assuming a soil column composed of three layers (i.e., top layer at 0.05&ndash;0.1 m, middle layer at 0.1&ndash;0.42 m, and bottom layer at 0.42&ndash;1.05 m). The thermal diffusivity in the three layers is assumed to be constant over time and equal to 0.16, 0.27 and 0.43 mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>&minus;1</sup> for the case of summer temperatures and 0.25, 0.75 and 0.6 mm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>&minus;1</sup> for autumn.</p>

Furthermore, a fourth control class with empty rooms is provided as well. Both parts of SDT are balanced sets of these four classes and room types. The synthetic part of the dataset is intended to be used as training (and validation) data for uni-/multi-modal pose classification or person detection models, while the real part can be used to assess the generalization performance. To facilitate supervised training, pose labels and person bounding boxes are provided for all images. The real images in the dataset were captured by a multi-modal stereo camera system, consisting of an Orbbec Astra depth camera and a Flir Lepton 3.5 thermal camera, while synthetic images, which share the image characteristics of these cameras, were acquired through 3D rendering of virtual scenes within Blender and subsequent introduction of camera-specific noise.</p>

However, the structural precision and consistency in assembling these structures is currently limited, which restricts intricate designs and the complexity of functions performed by synthetic tissues. Here, we report that the equilibrium contact angle (<i>θ<sub>DIB</sub></i>) between a pair of droplets is a key parameter that dictates the tessellation and precise positioning of hundreds of picolitre droplets within 3D-printed, multi-layer networks. When <i>θ<sub>DIB</sub></i> approximates the geometrically-derived critical angle (<i>θ<sub>c</sub></i>) of 35.3º, the resulting networks of droplets arrange in regular hexagonally close-packed (hcp) lattices with the least fraction of defects. With this improved control over droplet packing, we can 3D-print functional synthetic tissues with single-droplet-wide conductive pathways. Our new insights into 3D droplet packing permit the fabrication of complex synthetic tissues, where precisely positioned compartments perform coordinated tasks.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.2sv68,open,Data from: A synthetic cationic antimicrobial peptide inhibits inflammatory response and the NLRP3 inflammasome by neutralizing LPS and ATP,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are one of the most important defense mechanisms against bacterial infections in insects, plants, non-mammalian vertebrates, and mammals. In the present study, a class of synthetic AMPs was evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity. One cationic AMP, GW-A2, demonstrated the ability to inhibit the expression levels of nitric oxide (NO), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. GW-A2 reduced LPS-induced increases in the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C-α/δ and the activation of NF-κB. GW-A2 also inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by LPS and ATP. Furthermore, in the mice injected with LPS, GW-A2 reduced (1) the concentration of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum; (2) the concentration of TNF-α in the peritoneal lavage; (3) the expression levels of iNOS, COX-2 and NLRP3 in the liver and lung; (4) the infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the liver and lung. The underlying mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory activity of GW-A2 were found to be partially due to LPS and ATP neutralization. These results provide insights into how GW-A2 inhibits inflammation and the NLRP3 inflammasome and provide a foundation for the design of rational therapeutics for inflammation-related diseases."

As we move to building coordinated multicellular systems, the potential for such systems to display chaotic behaviour becomes a concern. Therefore understanding which systems show chaos is an important design consideration. We developed a methodology to explore the potential for chaotic dynamics in small microbial communities governed by resource competition, intercellular communication and competitive bacteriocin interactions. We show that we can expect to find chaotic states in relatively small synthetic microbial systems, understand the governing dynamics and provide insights into how to control such systems. This work is the first to query the existence of chaotic behaviour in synthetic microbial communities and has important ramifications for the fields of biotechnology, bioprocessing and synthetic biology.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.g79cnp5qg,open,Crossing design shapes patterns of genetic variation in synthetic recombinant populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"<p>""Synthetic recombinant"" populations have emerged as a useful tool for dissecting the genetics of complex traits.  They can be used to derive inbred lines for fine QTL mapping, or the populations themselves can be sampled for experimental evolution.  In latter application, investigators generally value maximizing genetic variation in constructed populations. This is because in evolution experiments initiated from such populations, adaptation is primarily fueled by standing genetic variation. Despite this reality, little has been done to systematically evaluate how different methods of constructing synthetic populations shape initial patterns of variation. Here we seek to address this issue by comparing outcomes in synthetic recombinant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> populations<i> </i>created using one of two strategies: pairwise crossing of isogenic strains or simple mixing of strains in equal proportion.  We also explore the impact of the varying the number of parental strains. We find that more genetic variation is initially present and maintained when population construction includes a round of pairwise crossing.  As perhaps expected, we also observe that increasing the number of parental strains typically increases genetic diversity. In summary, we suggest that when constructing populations for use in evolution experiments, simply mixing founder strains in equal proportion may limit the adaptive potential.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.1jwstqjt5,open,Evaluating natural experiments in ecology: using synthetic controls in assessments of remotely-sensed land-treatments,"Many important ecological phenomena occur on large spatial scales and/or are unplanned and thus do not easily fit within analytical frameworks which rely on randomization, replication, and interspersed a priori controls for statistical comparison. Analyses of such large-scale, natural experiments are common in the health and econometrics literature, where techniques have been developed to derive insight from large, noisy observational datasets. Here, we apply a technique from this literature, synthetic control, to assess landscape change with remote sensing data. The basic data requirements for synthetic control include: (1) a discrete set of treated and un-treated units, (2) a known date of treatment intervention, and (3) timeseries response data that includes both pre- and post-treatment outcomes for all units. Synthetic control generates a response metric for treated units relative to a no-action alternative based on prior relationships between treated and unexposed groups. Using simulations and a case study involving a large-scale brush clearing management event, we show how synthetic control can intuitively infer treatment effect sizes from satellite data, even in the presence of confounding noise from climate anomalies, long-term vegetation dynamics, or sensor errors. We find that accuracy depends on the number and quality of potential control units, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate control populations. Although we consider the synthetic control approach in the context of natural experiments with remote sensing data, we expect the methodology to have wider utility in ecology, particularly for systems with large, complex, and poorly replicated experimental units."

10.5061/dryad.4r910,open,Data from: Integrating sequence evolution into probabilistic orthology analysis,"Orthology analysis, that is, finding out whether a pair of homologous genes are orthologs — stemming from a speciation — or paralogs — stemming from a gene duplication - is of central importance in computational biology, genome annotation, and phylogenetic inference. In particular, an orthologous relationship makes functional equivalence of the two genes highly likely. A major approach to orthology analysis is to reconcile a gene tree to the corresponding species tree, (most commonly performed using the most parsimonious reconciliation, MPR). However, most such phylogenetic orthology methods infer the gene tree without considering the constraints implied by the species tree and, perhaps even more importantly, only allow the gene sequences to influence the orthology analysis through the a priori reconstructed gene tree. We propose a sound, comprehensive Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo-based method, DLRSOrthology, to compute orthology probabilities. It efficiently sums over the possible gene trees and jointly takes into account the current gene tree, all possible reconciliations to the species tree, and the, typically strong, signal conveyed by the sequences. We compare our method with PrIME-GEM, a probabilistic orthology approach built on a probabilistic duplication-loss model, and MRBAYESMPR, a probabilistic orthology approach that is based on conventional Bayesian inference coupled with MPR. We find that DLRSOrthology outperforms these competing approaches on synthetic data as well as on biological data sets and is robust to incomplete taxon sampling artifacts."

However, the fly is also present in the western U.S., where it may have been introduced via infested apples within the last 60 years. In addition to apple, R. pomonella also infests two hawthorns in the West, one the native black hawthorn, C. douglasii, and the other the introduced English ornamental hawthorn, C. monogyna. Here, we test for behavioral evidence of host races in the western U.S. through flight tunnel assays of western R. pomonella flies to host fruit volatile blends. We report that western apple, black hawthorn, and ornamental hawthorn flies showed significantly increased levels of upwind directed flight to their respective natal compared to non-natal fruit volatile blends, consistent with host race status. We discuss the implications of the behavioral results for the origin(s) of western R. pomonella, including the possibility that western apple flies were not introduced, but may represent a recent shift from local hawthorn fly populations."

There is strong ecological evidence for a positive relationship between species diversity and the functional output of communities. The pervasiveness of these communities in nature highlights that there may be advantages for engineered strains to exist in cocultures as well. Building synthetic microbial communities allows us to create distributed systems that mitigates issues often found in engineering a monoculture, especially when functional complexity is increasing. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for designing robust synthetic communities that use quorum sensing to control amensal bacteriocin interactions in a chemostat environment. We explore model spaces for two and three strain systems, using Bayesian methods to perform model selection, and identify the most robust candidates for producing stable steady state communities. Our findings highlight important interaction motifs that provide stability, and identify requirements for selecting genetic parts and tuning the community composition.</p>"

The main feature of this dataset is that it generates features with various patterns associated with the outcome variable and the causal effect (or treatment effect). Thus it is suitable for evaluating feature importance and model interpretation for uplift modeling.</p>

<p>This dataset consists of 100 trials (replicates with different random seeds), each trial with 10,000 samples and 36 features. The outcome variable is binary, that makes this dataset for classification problem. The samples are equally split for control and treatment group (5,000 samples in each group in each trial).</p>

<p>The generated data has three types of features: (1) uplift features influencing the treatment effect on the conversion probability; (2) classification features affecting the conversion probability but independent of the treatment effect; and (3) irrelevant features that are independent of both conversion probability and the treatment effect. To model the relationship between uplift features and the treatment effect and classification features and outcome probability, we implement six types of association patterns in the data generation process: linear, quadratic, cubic, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), trigonometric function sine, and cosine.</p>

<p>In this data set, there are 36 features in total, including 10 classification features, 6 uplift features, and 20 irrelevant features.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>Sharing data from clinical studies can facilitate innovative data-driven research and ultimately lead to better public health. However, sharing biomedical data can put sensitive personal information at risk. This is usually solved by anonymization, which is a slow and expensive process. An alternative to anonymization is sharing a synthetic dataset that bears a behaviour similar to the real data but preserves privacy. As part of the collaboration between Novartis and the Oxford Big Data Institute, we generate a synthetic dataset based on COSENTYX Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) clinical study. We apply an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ac-GAN) to generate synthetic magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of vertebral units (VUs). The images are conditioned on the VU location (cervical, thoracic and lumbar). In this paper, we present a method for generating a synthetic dataset and conduct an in-depth analysis on its properties of along three key metrics: image fidelity, sample diversity and dataset privacy.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.1408072,open,Observing substructure in circumstellar discs around massive young stellar objects,"<p>Synthetic dust continuum and molecular line Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of massive, self-gravitating disc models surrounding massive young stellar objects are presented here. Semi-analytic models of self-gravitating discs with spiral density waves and clumps/fragments are combined with radiative transfer models, and synthetic observations are produced using CASA software. Models presented here have different disc masses, distances, inclinations, thermal structures, dust distributions, number and orientation of spirals and fragments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
Data is in the FITS format, with filenames starting either with &#39;line&#39; (synthetic molecular line datacube) or &#39;cont&#39; (synthetic continuum images), and each filename contains the model ID. Tables of model IDs and model parameters are given in files models_table_spiral.dat and models_table_spiral_fragments.dat for models without and with fragments, respectively. Starting from a fiducial disc model, model parameters were varied one by one, with the exception of disc inclination which is separately set in each model.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
For details about the model parameters, detailed presentation of methods, proposed substructure-enhancing filtering methods, discussion and predictions for the upcoming ALMA observations, see Jankovic et al. 2018 (accepted for publication in MNRAS, arxiv.org/abs/1810.11398).</p>

10.5281/zenodo.4454971,open,VIPPrint: A Large Scale Dataset for Colored Printed Documents Authentication and Source Linking,"<p>The possibility of carrying out a meaningful forensics analysis on printed and scanned images plays a major role in many applications. First of all, printed documents are often associated with criminal activities, such as terrorist plans, child pornography pictures, and even fake packages. Additionally, printing and scanning can be used to hide the traces of image manipulation and even the synthetic nature of images, since the artifacts commonly found in manipulated and synthetic images are gone after the images are printed and scanned. A problem hindering research in this area is the lack of large scale reference datasets to be used for algorithm development and benchmarking. Motivated by this issue, we share a new dataset composed of a large number of synthetic and natural printed face images. &nbsp;Such a dataset can be used with several computer vision and machine learning approaches for two tasks: pinpointing the printer source of a document and detecting printed pictures generated by deep fakes.</p>

10.5061/dryad.z612jm6bt,open,Data from: Long-term (1979-present) total water storage anomalies over the global land derived by reconstructing GRACE data,"<p>This research data is associated with the manuscript entitled ""Long-term (1979-present) Total Water Storage Anomalies Over the Global Land Derived by Reconstructing GRACE data (https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL093492)"". The study focused on the reconstruction of long-term GRACE-like gridded total water storage anomalies over the global land surface. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has monitored global total water storage anomalies (TWSA) with an unprecedented accuracy. Yet, many applications require a longer record, i.e. extending prior to the GRACE period. Besides, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Steering Committee has made great efforts towards establishing TWSA as a new Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Here, we produced a new global (excluding Antarctica) total water storage anomaly data set by reconstructing the RL06 CSR mascons using precipitation, land temperature, sea surface temperature, soil moisture, evaporation, surface runoff, subsurface runoff, and several climate indices as inputs. The data set is provided with equivalent water height [unit: cm]. The grid resolution of this data set is 0.5° and the monthly time series covers the full period from July 1979 through June 2020. We compared our dataset to previously published products using the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) solution and the observed global mean sea level change as validations. The comparison suggests that we provided a more accurate dataset at the global scale than ever before. This dataset will contribute to the filling of the GRACE data gap and can contribute to the potential studies on testing climate model simulation, constructing the sea level budget, or understanding drought/flood events prior to the GRACE period.</p>"

10.5281/zenodo.4276130,open,Rule-based Synthetic Data for Japanese GEC,"<pre>Title: Rule-based Synthetic Data for Japanese GEC
<strong>Dataset Contents:</strong>
This dataset contains two parallel corpora intended for the training and evaluating of models for the NLP (natural language processing) subtask of Japanese GEC (grammatical error correction). These are as follows:

<strong>Synthetic Corpus - *synthesized_data.tsv*</strong>
This corpus file contains 2,179,130 parallel sentence pairs synthesized using the process described in [1]. Each line of the file consists of two sentences delimited by a tab. The first sentence is the erroneous sentence while the second is the corresponding correction.

These paired sentences are derived from data scraped from the keyword-lookup site &lt;yourei.jp&gt;. The data within this file is primarily intended to serve as or augment a training set for a Japanese GEC model. Overall the sentences cover a broad array of primarily simple Japanese grammatical errors.

<strong>Teacher Corpus - *teacher_data.tsv*</strong>
This corpus file contains 6,345 parallel sentence pairs created via  what we call the &quot;teacher-sourcing&quot; project [2]. The corpus sentences were created by Japanese language teachers, and this &quot;teacher-sourcing&quot; was funded by the Japan Foundation, Los Angeles. The overall format of the file is similar to that of *synthesized_data.tsv*, with each line containing an erroneous sentence and a corresponding correction separated by a comma.

In addition, each erroneous sentence and correction sentence also contain pairs of characters that delimit the specific location within the sentence where the error/correction occur. For the erroneous sentence, these characters are `&lt;` and `&gt;`, while for the correction sentence, these are `(` and `)`.

For example, consider the following sentence pair:

 - Error: &lt;汚れる服&gt;をあらいました。
 - Correction: (汚れた服)をあらいました。

The delimiter characters indicate that the error phrase is `汚れる服` while the corresponding correction is `汚れた服`

These paired sentences were written to mimic commonly grammatical errors produced by Japanese langauge learners; thus this file&#39;s data is primarily intended to serve as a evaluation set for Japanese GEC models.

______

In addition, the dataset contains the rule file used to generate the synthetic data within *synthesized_data.tsv*:

### Rule File - *rule_set.tsv*
This file contains the 400 &quot;syntactic rules&quot; used to generate the data within *synthesized_data.tsv*. Each line contains a single rule, with different attributes delimited by tabs. Consult pages 41-66 of [1] for a more detailed analysis of these &quot;syntactic rules&quot; and the manner in which they are used to produce the synthetic data.

10.5281/zenodo.5759312,open,Comparing natural hydrogels to self-assembling peptides in spinal cord injury treatment: a systematic review,"<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Background:</strong></em><em>&nbsp;</em>In many cases, central nervous system (CNS) injury is unchanging due to the absence of neuronal regeneration and repair capabilities.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In recent years, regenerative medicine, and especially hydrogels, have reached a significant amount of attention for their promising results for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) currently considered permanent. Hydrogels are categorized based on their foundation: synthetic, natural, and combination.&nbsp;The objective of this study was to compare the properties and efficacy of commonly used hydrogels, like collagen, and other natural peptides with synthetic self-assembling peptide hydrogels in the treatment of SCI.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Methods</strong></em><em>:</em><em>&nbsp;</em>Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. All studies from 1985 until January 2020 were included in the primary search. Eligible articles were included based on the following criteria: administering hydrogels (both natural and synthetic) for SCI treatment,&nbsp; soley foucsing on spinal cord injury treatment, and published in a peer-reviewd journal. Data surronding xonal regeneration, revascularization, elasticity, drug delivery efficacy, and porosity were extracted.</p>

<p><em><strong>Results:</strong></em>&nbsp;A total of 24 articles were included for full-text review and data extraction. There were only one experimental study directly comparing Collagen I (as natural hydorgel) and PEG (as synthetic hydrogels) in an <em>in vitro </em>setting. The included study suggested PEG&rsquo;s cell behavior is more expectable in the injury site, which makes it a more reliable scaffold.</p>

<p><em><strong>Conclusions:</strong></em>&nbsp;There is limited research comparing and evaluating both types of natural and self-assembling peptides (SAPs) in the same animal or <em>in vitro</em> study, despite its importance. Although we assume that the remodeling of natural scaffolds may lead to a stable hydrogel, there was not a definitive conclusion that synthetic hydrogels are more beneficial than natural hydrogels in neuronal regeneration.</p>"

In northwestern Australia, invasion of the cane toad (Rhinella marina) kills many native predators if they ingest the highly toxic toads. Remarkably, the toads' defensive toxins (bufadienolides) are chemically similar to those of another invasive species: an ornamental plant from Madagascar, Bryophyllum spp. (Crassulaceae, mother-of-millions). Omnivorous lizards (bluetongue skinks, Tiliqua scincoides) are imperiled by the invasion of toads in northwestern Australia, but conspecifics from other areas of the continent (those where exotic plants were introduced and including areas where toads have yet to invade) are less affected because they exhibit higher physiological tolerance of toad toxins (and also of plant toxins). The willingness of captive bluetongues to consume both toads and these plants and the high correlation in the lizards' sensitivity to toad toxins versus plant toxins suggest that exotic plants may have imposed strong selection on the lizards' physiological tolerance of bufadienolides. As a result, populations of lizards from areas previously exposed to these alien plants may be preadapted to deal with the toxins of the more recent anuran invader."

Each problem consists of an UI Log including a synthetic screenshot for each event in the log.<br>
The evaluation is based on a set of synthetic problems which resemble realistic use cases in the administrative domain. More precisely, 3 different processes (<em>P</em>) are created, each of them with a different level of complexity. Complexity is measured in terms of the number of activities, the number of variants to execute the process, and the number of visual features that affect the decision to choose between variants). The processes are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>P1 Client creation</em>. A process with&nbsp;<strong>5 activities and 2 variants</strong>. The single decision in this process is made based on the existence of an attachment in the reception email.</li>
	<li><em>P2 Client validation</em>. A process with&nbsp;<strong>7 activities and 2 variants</strong>. The decision is made based on the user&rsquo;s response to a query.</li>
	<li><em>P3 Client deletion</em>. A process with&nbsp;<strong>7 activities and 4 variants</strong>. The decisions are made based on two conditions: (1) the existence of pending invoices and (2) the existence of an attachment to justify the payment of the invoices.</li>
</ul>

<p>These processes all contain a single decision point, although the one in P3 is complex. All processes include</p>

<ol>
	<li>synthetic screen captures for their activities and</li>
	<li>a sample event log with a single instance for each variant.</li>
</ol>

<p>To generate the objects for the valuation, we generate event logs of different sizes (|<em>L</em>|) for each of these processes by deriving events from the sample event log. We consider log sizes in the range of {10, 25, 50, 100} events. Note that we consider complete instances in the log and thus, we remove the last instance if it goes beyond |<em>L</em>|.<br>
Some of these logs are generated with a balanced number of instances, while others are unbalanced (<em>B</em>?) which present more than 20% of different frequency between the most frequent and less frequent variants. To average the result over a collection of problems, 30 instances are randomly generated for each tuple &lt;&nbsp;<em>P</em>, |<em>L</em>|,&nbsp;<em>B</em>? &gt;.<br>
In this dataset there are 3 zips, one for each family. Each family corresponds to a process:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Basic </em>corresponds to P1</li>
	<li><em>Intermediate </em>corresponds to P12</li>
	<li><em>Advanced </em>corresponds to P3</li>
</ul>

<p>Within these folders, we find 30 different scenarios (folder), in which the look and feel of the applications present in the screenshots have suffered little variations. Within each of these scenarios, variations are carried out respecting to the data entered in the forms and the images or attachments present in the user interface to generate log instances depending on the characteristics of each process.<br>
For each scenario, we find 8 folders with the concrete problem which is defined by Log_size (in {10,25,50,100}) and Balanced (in {Balanced, Unbalanced}). The name of these folders have this format<em>: Family_LogSize_Balanced.</em><br>
Inside each problem folder the UI Log and the screen captures can be found.</p>"

10.5281/zenodo.886516,open,Synthetic tetrode recording dataset with spike-waveform drift,"<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>This synthetic ground-truth dataset accurately models long-term, continuous extracellular tetrode recordings from the rodent brain over a time-period of 256 hours. Each ""recording"" comprises spiking of 8 distinct single-units with firing rates ranging from 0.1 - 6 Hz, superimposed on background multi-unit spiking activity at 20 Hz. The recording sampling rate is 30 kHz. Single-unit spike amplitudes drift over a range of 100 to 400 <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mu V\)</span> based on the drift we observe in our own long-term recordings from the rodent motor cortex and striatum. For more details, please see our paper ""Automated long-term recording and analysis of neural activity in behaving animals"" ( https://doi.org/10.1101/033266).</p>

<p>These recordings can be used to test the accuracy of spike-sorting algorithms when clustering non-stationary spike waveform data, such as our own Fast Automated Spike Tracker (FAST) outlined in our paper and available at https://github.com/Olveczky-Lab/FAST.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Dataset</strong></p>

<p>Due to size restrictions, we provide here 1 sample tetrode of the full 6 tetrode dataset. Please contact us (https://olveczkylab.oeb.harvard.edu/about) if you require access to the other 5 synthetic tetrode recordings.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The dataset comprises spike times and spike waveform snippets extracted a continuous synthetic tetrode recording. Provided are...</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <strong>SpikeTimes</strong> file with a list of sample numbers for detected events (spikes) at <em>uint64</em> precision.</li>
	<li>A <strong>Spikes</strong> file with the waveforms of the detected events in <em>int16</em> precision. Each event waveform comprises <em>4 channels X 64 samples</em> 16-bit words arranged in the order [Ch0-Sample0, Ch1-Sample0, Ch2-Sample0, Ch3-Sample0, Ch0-Sample1, etc.]. To convert to units of voltage, change type to double precision and multiply by 1.95e-7.</li>
	<li>A <strong>SnippeterSettings.xml</strong> file with snippeting parameters (this is auto-generated by the FAST snippeting algorithm).</li>
	<li>A <strong>dataset_params.mat</strong> MATLAB data file containing the simulation parameters. The most important variables in the mat file are <em>sp</em> which contains a list of true spike-times (in samples @ 30 kHz) for all single-units in the dataset, and <em>sp_u</em> which specifies which unit (1-8) each spike originates from.

<p>This dataset contains 10,000 samples and 36 features (one trial).</p>

<p>The samples are equally split for control and treatment group.</p>

<p>The generated data has three types of features: (1) uplift features influencing the treatment effect on the conversion probability; (2) classification features affecting the conversion probability but independent of the treatment effect; and (3) irrelevant features that are independent of both conversion probability and the treatment effect. To model the relationship between uplift features and the treatment effect and classification features and outcome probability, we implement six types of association patterns in the data generation process: linear, quadratic, cubic, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), trigonometric function sine, and cosine.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.4454551,open,SIDIRE: Synthetic Image Dataset for Illumination Robustness Evaluation,"<p>SIDIRE is a freely available image dataset which provides synthetically generated images allowing to investigate the influence of illumination changes on object appearance. The images are renderings of 3D coin models with different material BRDFs and levels of texturedness. Thus, the dataset makes it possible to directly evaluate the influence of these conditions on the performance of image recognition without introducing a bias due to different objects used between image sets. The dataset has been used for evaluation in [1].</p>

<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>

<p>The dataset is freely available for non-commercial research use. Please cite our paper [1] when using the dataset for your research.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Details</strong></p>

<p>Full Image Dataset</p>

<p>The full image dataset consists of images of 14 coin models which have been rendered using the open-source graphics software <a href=""http://www.blender.org"">Blender</a>. For each model, twelve sets of 500&times;500 images with 65 illumination directions were rendered where each set represents one out of four material BRDFs and one out of three texture density levels. Material BRDFs are intended to represent different levels of specularity starting from a Lambertian material with zero specularity up to specular intensity values of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00. The first texture density level shows no texture and thus represents the set of textureless objects. For the remaining two levels synthetically generated textures were used. The camera image plane is placed parallel to the coin and light source positions are defined by their azimuth angle &phi; and elevation angle &lambda;. We used eight levels of &lambda; with eight levels of &phi; each to produce 64 images. The 65th image is rendered with the light placed at the camera position (i.e. &lambda;=90&deg;).<br>
In the provided RAR-file, all the 65 images of a specific model, specularity level and texturedness level are contained in separate directories. For instance, the directory &lsquo;texture_level0\Ref_level2\2874-back&rsquo; contains the images of the model &lsquo;2874-back&rsquo; rendered without texture and a specularity of 0.50.</p>

<p><strong>Patch Dataset</strong></p>

<p>The patch dataset contains 50000 matching patch pairs for every of the 12 subsets of SIDIRE. It can be used to generate groups of feature distances by means of true and false patch pairs, in the same manner as, e.g., Matthew Brown&rsquo;s <a href=""http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/patches/default.htm"">patch dataset</a>. Please see [1,2] for a detailed description of the evaluation scheme of patch pair databases.<br>
The patches have a size of 64&times;64 and are arranged in images of size 3200&times;3200. Thus, every image contains 2500 patches where corresponding patches are placed side by side. The patches of the 12 subsets are contained in directories indicating their texture density and reflectance level, e.g. patches rendered without texture and a specularity of 0.50 are contained in the directory &lsquo;tex0_ref2&rsquo;.<br>

10.6071/M3066D,open,Remineralizing Enamel : A Literature Review,"<p><strong>Background</strong>: Tooth enamel is a non-living tissue, once matured it can no longer remineralization itself. Unfortunately, there are only a few studies that analyze the risks and benefits in applications towards remineralization. The objective was to examine the effectiveness and risks of synthetic applications towards remineralizing tooth enamel.<br>
<strong>Methods: </strong>Experimental trials focusing on the effect of synthetic applications on tooth enamel such as, surface hardness, surface thickness and overall effectiveness were included in this review. Published articles from 1978 to 2018 were identified using specific keywords terms in the ScienceDirect and PubMed database. Each study was independently screened to meet eligibility and asses risk of bias, if any.<br>
<strong>Results:</strong> Seven experimental reports applying three synthetic methods: Ca/PI ratios of stimulated saliva, Nano-hydroxyapatite and Calcarea Fluorica tablets were evaluated. Application process and outcomes varied throughout each study. Ca/PI ratios of stimulated saliva did not affect the remineralization process significantly (P &gt; 0.5) and was associated with no harms on the molars used. Studies evaluating the use of synthetic nano-hydroxyapatite displayed statistically significant (P &lt; 0.5) outcomes towards remineralization increasing surface hardness and thickness. One study analyzed the effects of Calcarea Fluorica tablets reporting the most overall increase in remineralization but mostly towards surface hardness, as well as being statistically significant (P &lt; 0.5).<br>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Studies were limited and short term, leaving room for error and miscalculation. However, there is data that expresses overall positive effects towards remineralization. The results show a need for future experimental trials on synthetics to get a better understanding in this area.</p>

10.5061/dryad.3543v,open,Data from: Allopolyploidy and the evolution of plant virus resistance,"Background: The relationship between allopolyploidy and plant virus resistance is poorly understood. To determine the relationship of plant evolutionary history and basal virus resistance, a panel of Nicotiana species from diverse geographic regions and ploidy levels was assessed for resistance to non-coevolved viruses from the genus Nepovirus, family Secoviridae. The heritability of resistance was tested in a panel of synthetic allopolyploids. Leaves of different positions on each inoculated plant were tested for virus presence and a subset of plants was re-inoculated and assessed for systemic recovery. Results: Depending on the host-virus combination, plants displayed immunity, susceptibility or intermediate levels of resistance. Synthetic allopolyploids showed an incompletely dominant resistance phenotype and manifested systemic recovery. Plant ploidy was weakly negatively correlated with virus resistance in Nicotiana species, but this trend did not hold when synthetic allopolyploids were taken into account. Furthermore, a relationship between resistance and geographical origin was observed. Conclusion: The gradients of resistance and virulence corresponded to a modified matching allele model of resistance. Intermediate resistance responses of allopolyploids corresponded with a model of multi-allelic additive resistance. The variable virus resistance of extant allopolyploids suggested that selection-based mechanisms surpass ploidy with respect to evolution of basal resistance to viruses."
10.1111/cgf.14271,open,NOVA: Rendering Virtual Worlds with Humans for Computer Vision Tasks,"<p>Today, the cutting edge of computer vision research greatly depends on the availability of large datasets, which are critical for effectively training and testing new methods. Manually annotating visual data, however, is not only a labor-intensive process but also prone to errors. In this study, we present NOVA, a versatile framework to create realistic-looking 3D rendered worlds containing procedurally generated humans with rich pixel-level ground truth annotations. NOVA can simulate various environmental factors such as weather conditions or different times of day, and bring an exceptionally diverse set of humans to life, each having a distinct body shape, gender and age. To demonstrate NOVA&#39;s capabilities, we generate two synthetic datasets for person tracking. The first one includes 108 sequences, each with different levels of difficulty like tracking in crowded scenes or at nighttime and aims for testing the limits of current state-of-the-art trackers. A second dataset of 97 sequences with normal weather conditions is used to show how our synthetic sequences can be utilized to train and boost the performance of deep-learning based trackers. Our results indicate that the synthetic data generated by NOVA represents a good proxy of the real-world and can be exploited for computer vision tasks.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.34tmpg4jp,open,An alternative and highly efficient synthetic protocol of Osimertinib,"<p><span>Osimertinib, a third generation potent and specific EGFR inhibitor is an important drug against many forms of cancer. It was synthesized by an improved and highly efficient protocol, revisiting the classical synthetic process and modifying parameters, such as solvents, temperature, reagents, and reaction time. A cost-effective, environmentally friendly methodology for the synthesis of Osimertinib was established, which gave shorter reaction times, saved labor by eliminating purification steps through column chromatography, and enhanced yields. Four of the seven steps in total, were proceeded quantitatively or almost quantitatively (~ 98%). This synthetic protocol provides a very high overall yield, up to 68%. In addition, the entire approach enables the preparation of Osimertinib analogues and could be extended in the synthesis of other structurally similar bioactive compounds</span><span>.</span></p>"

<p>Table of contents:</p>

<p><strong>1. Dataset 1</strong>; Excel file with the curated data underlying the figures.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> (F) Comparison of promoters cloned in the tier-1 scaffold, including minimal promoters (PTKmin, Pmin, PCMVmin-2, PMLP, and PCMVmin-1) and constitutive promoters (PTK, PSV40, PmPGK1, PhCMV, PhEF1a, and PRPBSA) was assessed in terms of SEAP production. (G-H) Modulation of the rtTA-based tet-ON system with different (G) minimal promoters and (H) suppressor (TS) 5&rsquo;UTR sequences or destabilizing ribozymes (sTRSV and env140) in the 3&rsquo;UTR was assessed in terms of SEAP production.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> (C-D) Expression characterization of each cassette of the tier-2 construct is tested by inserting expression cassettes controlled by the moderately strong phospho-glycerate kinase (PmPGK1) or strong human cytomegalovirus-derived (PhCMV) promoter. (C) Expression comparison of each cassette of the tier-2 construct tested individually was assessed in terms of Nluc production. (D) Characterization of interference between promoters of different strengths (PhCMV and PmPGK1) encoded in individual constructs or cloned into a single tier-2 construct. PhCMV expression was assessed in terms of SEAP production and PmPGK1 expression was assessed in terms of Nluc production. The reporters were transfected individually, cotransfected (+), or expressed from the same plasmid (|). (E) Characterization of interference between a constitutive promoter (PmPGK1) and an inducible promoter (PCRE). PmPGK1 driving firefly luciferase (Fluc) and a synthetic inducible cAMP-responsive (PCRE) promoter driving Nluc were cloned into different expression cassettes of a single tier-2 construct. Levels of Nluc activity are normalized to Fluc activity. (G-J) Generation of a single tier-2 construct encoding four different well-established synthetic gene switches: (G) the doxycycline-regulated rtTA system, (H) the doxycycline-regulated tTA system, (I) the vanillic acid-regulated VanA system, and (J) the phloretin-regulated TtgA system were all assessed in terms of SEAP production</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3. </strong>(C) Characterization of polyclonal stable cell lines generated with the tier-3 PB and SB constructs encoding Tet-responsive inducible SEAP-p2A-iRFP670 in the first cassette (A1), constitutively expressed rtTA in the second cassette (A2), and constitutively expressed YPet-p2A-PuroR in the third cassette (A3) demonstrated dose-dependent induction of SEAP expression in response to doxycycline. (F) Characterization of polyclonal stable cell lines generated with the tier-3 lentiviral constructs encoding Tet-responsive inducible SEAP-p2A-iRFP670 in the first cassette (A1), constitutively expressed rtTA in the second cassette (A2), and constitutively expressed YPet-p2A-PuroR in the third cassette (A3) show dose-dependent induction of SEAP expression in response to doxycycline. (J) Characterization monoclonal lines generated with the CRISPR tier-3 constructs encoding Tet-responsive inducible SEAP-p2A-iRFP670 in the first cassette (A1), constitutively expressed rtTA in the second cassette (A2) show dose-dependent induction of SEAP expression in response to doxycycline.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figure S1.</strong> Characterization of functional genetic elements that can reduce interference between promoters of different strengths (PhCMV and PmPGK1) encoded in a single tier-2 construct. PhCMV-driven expression was assessed in terms of SEAP production and PmPGK1-driven expression was assessed in terms of Nluc production. The reporters were transfected individually, cotransfected (+), or expressed from the same plasmid (|). Functional genetic elements, including a plasmid backbone spacer sequence [spacer], a synthetic poly(A) signal/transcriptional pause site derived from a commercial vector [pGL3], a co-transcriptional cleavage element [CoTC], a transcriptional termination sequence derived from the human &beta;-globin gene [Tactb], or an insulator sequence consisting of two repeats of chicken hypersensitive site 4 [2xcHS4] were introduced directly 5&rsquo; of the PmPGK1-NLuc expression cassette encoded in either the (A) A2 or (B) A3 insertion site.</p>

The polyclonal stable cell lines were induced with doxycycline for 48 h and then sorted based on iRFP670 expression to isolated high-expressing clones. (A-B) The sorted PB generated sub-populations were assayed for (A) dose-dependent induction of SEAP, as well as (B) iRFP670 reporter mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) output in response to doxycycline. (D-E) The sorted SB generated sub-populations were assayed for (D) dose-dependent induction of SEAP expression, as well as (E) iRFP670 reporter MFI output in response to doxycycline. (G-H) The sorted lentiviral generated sub-population was assayed for (G) dose-dependent induction of SEAP expression, as well as (H) iRFP670 reporter MFI output in response to doxycycline.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.9m8ff,open,Data from: RClone: a package to identify MultiLocus Clonal Lineages and handle clonal datasets in R,"Partially clonal species are common in the Tree of Life. And yet, population genetics models still mostly focus on the extremes: strictly sexual versus purely asexual reproduction. Here we present an R package built upon GenClone software including new functions and several improvements. The RClone package includes functions to handle clonal datasets, allowing (i) checking for dataset reliability to discriminate multi-locus genotypes (MLG), (ii) ascertainment of MLG and semi-automatic determination of clonal lineages (MLL), (iii) genotypic richness and evenness indices calculation based on MLGs or MLLs, and (iv) describing several spatial components of clonality. RClone allows the one shot analysis of multi-population datasets without size limitation, suitable for datasets now increasingly produced through Next Generation Sequencing. A major improvement compared to existing software is the ability to determine the threshold to cluster similar MLGs into MLLs, based on implemented simulations of sexual events. Several functions allow data importation, conversion and exportation with adegenet, Genetix or Arlequin. RClone is provided with two vignettes to handle analysis on one (RClone_quickmanual) or several populations (RClone_qmsevpops)."

10.5061/dryad.7sqv9s4p3,open,The distribution and spread of naturally occurring Medea selfish genetic elements in the United States,"<p>Selfish genetic elements (SGEs) are DNA sequences that are transmitted to viable offspring in greater than Mendelian frequencies. <i>Medea</i> SGEs occur naturally in some populations of red flour beetle (<i>Tribolium castaneum</i>) and are expected to increase in frequency within populations and spread among populations. The large-scale USA distributions of <i>Medea-4</i> (M<sup>4</sup>) had been mapped based on samples from 1993-1995. We sampled beetles in 2011-2014 and show that the distribution of M<sup>4</sup> in the United States is dynamic and has shifted southward. By using a genetic marker of <i>Medea-1</i> (M<sup>1</sup>), we found five unique geographic clusters with high- and low M<sup>1</sup> frequencies in a pattern not predicted by microsatellite-based analysis of population structure. Our results indicate absence of rigid barriers to <i>Medea</i> spread in the USA, so assessment of what factors have limited its current distribution require further investigation. There is great interest in using synthetic SGEs, including synthetic <i>Medea</i>, to alter or suppress pest populations, but there is concern about unpredicted spread of these SGE's and potential for populations to become resistant to them. The finding of patchy distributions of <i>Medea</i> elements suggests that released synthetic SGEs cannot always be expected to spread uniformly, especially in target species with limited dispersal.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.r0g9m,open,Data from: Spore germination determines yeast inbreeding according to fitness in the local environment,"Gene combinations conferring local fitness may be destroyed by mating with individuals that are adapted to a different environment. This form of outbreeding depression provides an evolutionary incentive for self-fertilization. We show that the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus tends to self-fertilize when it is well adapted to its local environment but tends to outcross when it is poorly adapted. This behavior could preserve combinations of genes when they are beneficial and break them up when they are not, thereby helping adaptation. Haploid spores must germinate before mating, and we found that fitter spores had higher rates of germination across a 24-hour period, increasing the probability that they mate with germinated spores from the same meiotic tetrad. The ability of yeast spores to detect local conditions before germinating and mating suggests the novel possibility that these gametes directly sense their own adaptation and plastically adjust their breeding strategy accordingly."

10.5061/dryad.sj179,open,Data from: An experimental study of the putative mechanism of a synthetic autonomous rotary DNA nanomotor,"DNA has been used to construct a wide variety of nanoscale molecular devices. Inspiration for such synthetic molecular machines is frequently drawn from protein motors, which are naturally occurring and ubiquitous. However, despite the fact that rotary motors such as ATP synthase and the bacterial flagellar motor play extremely important roles in nature, very few rotary devices have been constructed using DNA. This paper describes an experimental study of the putative mechanism of a rotary DNA nanomotor, which is based on strand displacement, the phenomenon that powers many synthetic linear DNA motors. Unlike other examples of rotary DNA machines, the device described here is designed to be capable of autonomous operation after it is triggered. The experimental results are consistent with operation of the motor as expected, and future work on an enhanced motor design may allow rotation to be observed at the single-molecule level.

The success of CAR-T cell therapies highlights the promise of programmed immunity and suggests that applying CAR strategies to other immune cell lineages may be beneficial. Here, we engineered a family of Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis (CAR-Ps) that direct macrophages to engulf specific targets, including cancer cells. CAR-Ps consist of an extracellular antibody fragment, which can be modified to direct CAR-P activity towards specific antigens. By screening a panel of engulfment receptor intracellular domains, we found that the cytosolic domains from Megf10 and FcRɣ robustly triggered engulfment independently of their native extracellular domain. We show that CAR-Ps drive specific engulfment of antigen-coated synthetic particles and whole human cancer cells. Addition of a tandem PI3K recruitment domain increased cancer cell engulfment. Finally, we show that
CAR-P expressing murine macrophages reduce cancer cell number in co-culture by over 40%."

The expansion of the PPR superfamily in plants provides the sequence variation required for design of consensus-based RNA-binding proteins. We used this approach to design a synthetic RNA editing factor to target one of the sites in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> chloroplast transcriptome recognised by the natural editing factor CHLOROPLAST BIOGENESIS 19 (CLB19). We show that our synthetic editing factor specifically recognises the target sequence in in vitro binding assays. The designed factor is equally specific for the target <i>rpoA</i> site when expressed in chloroplasts and in the bacterium <i>E. coli</i>. This study serves as a successful pilot into the design and application of programmable RNA editing factors based on plant PPR proteins.                                               </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

10.1016/j.imavis.2021.104187,open,Using synthetic data for person tracking under adverse weather conditions,"<p>Robust visual tracking plays a vital role in many areas such as autonomous cars, surveillance and robotics. Recent trackers were shown to achieve adequate results under normal tracking scenarios with clear weather conditions, standard camera setups and lighting conditions. Yet, the performance of these trackers, whether they are correlation filter-based or learning-based, degrade under adverse weather conditions. The lack of videos with such weather conditions, in the available visual object tracking datasets, is the prime issue behind the low performance of the learning-based tracking algorithms. In this work, we provide a new person tracking dataset of real-world sequences (PTAW172Real) captured under foggy, rainy and snowy weather conditions to assess the performance of the current trackers. We also introduce a novel person tracking dataset of synthetic sequences (PTAW217Synth) procedurally generated by our NOVA framework spanning the same weather conditions in varying severity to mitigate the problem of data scarcity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performances of the state-of-the-art deep trackers under adverse weather conditions can be boosted when the available real training sequences are complemented with our synthetically generated dataset during training.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.wm37pvmj6,open,Synthetic soil crusts against green-desert transitions: a spatial model,"<p>Semiarid ecosystems are threatened by global warming due to longer dehydration times and increasing soil degradation. Mounting evidences indicate that, given the current trends, drylands are likely to expand and possibly experience catastrophic shifts from vegetated to desert states. Here we explore a recent suggestion based on the concept of ecosystem terraformation, where a synthetic organism is used to counterbalance some of the nonlinear effects causing the presence of such tipping points. Using an explicit spatial model incorporating facilitation and considering a simplification of states found in semiarid ecosystems i.e., vegetation, fertile and desert soil, we investigate how engineered microorganisms can shape the fate of these ecosystems. Specifically, two different, but complementary, terraformation strategies are proposed: Cooperation-based: C-terraformation; and Dispersion-based: D-terraformation. The first strategy involves the use of soil synthetic microorganisms to introduce cooperative loops (facilitation) with the vegetation. The second one involves the introduction of engineered microorganisms improving their dispersal capacity, thus facilitating the transition from desert to fertile soil. We show that small modifications enhancing cooperative loops can effectively change the location of the critical transition found at increasing soil degradation rates, also identifying a stronger protection against soil degradation by using the D-terraformation strategy. The same results are found in a mean field model providing insights into the transitions and dynamics tied to these terraformation strategies. The potential consequences and extensions of these models are discussed.</p>"

The capacity for combinatorial processing is present to different degrees in some mammals and birds. We tested for basic combinatorial processing in an insect against two competing hypotheses: beginning rule (where the early signal portions play a stronger role in acceptability); and no rule (where the order of signal elements plays no role in signal acceptability). We worked with  Enchenopa  treehoppers, whose vibrational signals consist of a whine (W) followed by pulses (P). The combinatorial rule hypothesis predicts females will prefer any stimuli containing the natural-combination (WP or PWP) over reverse-order stimuli (PW). The beginning rule hypothesis predicts that females will prefer stimuli with natural beginnings (WP or W) over stimuli with modified beginnings (PW or PWP). The no rules hypothesis predicts no preferences in stimuli acceptability. In playback
experiments using laser vibrometry, females preferred natural-combination signals regardless of the beginning element (WP or PWP) and discriminated against reverse-order signals (PW) or individual elements (W or P). Finding support for the combinatorial rule hypothesis in insects suggests that this capability represents a common solution to the problems presented by complex communication."

10.5061/dryad.d9v38,open,Data from: The functional diversity of retinal ganglion cells in the mouse,"In the vertebrate visual system, all output of the retina is carried by retinal ganglion cells. Each type encodes distinct visual features in parallel for transmission to the brain. How many such 'output channels' exist and what each encodes are areas of intense debate. In the mouse, anatomical estimates range from 15 to 20 channels, and only a handful are functionally understood. By combining two-photon calcium imaging to obtain dense retinal recordings and unsupervised clustering of the resulting sample of more than 11,000 cells, here we show that the mouse retina harbours substantially more than 30 functional output channels. These include all known and several new ganglion cell types, as verified by genetic and anatomical criteria. Therefore, information channels from the mouse eye to the mouse brain are considerably more diverse than shown thus far by anatomical studies, suggesting an encoding strategy resembling that used in state-of-the-art artificial vision systems."
10.25338/B8TP7G,open,Blueprint for phasing and assembling the genomes of heterozygous polyploids:  Application to the octoploid genome of strawberry,"<p>The challenge of allelic diversity for assembling haplotypes is exemplified in polyploid genomes containing homoeologous chromosomes of identical ancestry, and significant homologous variation within their ancestral subgenomes. Cultivated strawberry (<i>Fragaria</i> × <i>ananassa</i>) and its progenitors are outbred octoploids in which up to eight homologous and homoeologous alleles are preserved. This introduces significant risk of haplotype collapse, switching, and chimeric fusions during assembly. Using third generation HiFi sequences from PacBio, we assembled the genome of the day-neutral octoploid <i>F.</i> × <i>ananassa</i> hybrid 'Royal Royce' from the University of California. Our goal was to produce subgenome- and haplotype-resolved assemblies of all 56 chromosomes, accurately reconstructing the parental haploid chromosome complements.  Previous work has demonstrated that partitioning sequences by parental phase supports direct assembly of haplotypes in heterozygous diploid species. We leveraged the accuracy of HiFi sequence data with pedigree-informed sequencing to partition long read sequences by phase, and reduce the downstream risk of subgenomic chimeras during assembly. We were able to utilize an octoploid strawberry recombination breakpoint map containing 3.6 M variants to identify and break chimeric junctions, and perform scaffolding of the phase-1 and phase-2 octoploid assemblies. The N50 contiguity of the phase-1 and phase-2 assemblies prior to scaffolding and gap-filling was 11 Mb. The final haploid assembly represented seven of 28 chromosomes in a single contiguous sequence, and averaged fewer than three gaps per pseudomolecule. Additionally, we re-annotated the octoploid genome to produce a custom <i>F. </i>× <i>ananassa</i> repeat library and improved set of gene models based on IsoSeq transcript data and an expansive RNA-seq expression atlas. Here we present 'FaRR1', a gold-standard reference genome of <i>F. </i>× <i>ananassa</i> cultivar 'Royal Royce' to assist future genomic research and molecular breeding of allo-octoploid strawberry.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.kv072,open,Data from: Anthropogenic disruption of the night sky darkness in urban and rural areas,"The growing emissions of artificial light to the atmosphere are producing, among other effects, a significant increase of the night sky brightness (NSB) above its expected natural values. A permanent sensor network has been deployed in Galicia (northwest of Iberian peninsula) to monitor the anthropogenic disruption of the night sky darkness in a countrywide area. The network is composed of 14 detectors integrated in automated weather stations of MeteoGalicia, the Galician public meteorological agency. Zenithal NSB readings are taken every minute and the results are openly available in real time for researchers, interested stakeholders and the public at large through a dedicated website. The measurements allow one to assess the extent of the loss of the natural night in urban, periurban, transition and dark rural sites, as well as its daily and monthly time courses. Two metrics are introduced here to characterize the disruption of the night darkness across the year: the significant magnitude (m1/3) and the moonlight modulation factor (γ). The significant magnitude shows that in clear and moonless nights the zenithal night sky in the analysed urban settings is typically 14–23 times brighter than expected from a nominal natural dark sky. This factor lies in the range 7–8 in periurban sites, 1.6–2.5 in transition regions and 0.8–1.6 in rural and mountain dark sky places. The presence of clouds in urban areas strongly enhances the amount of scattered light, easily reaching amplification factors in excess of 25, in comparison with the light scattered in the same places under clear sky conditions. The periodic NSB modulation due to the Moon, still clearly visible in transition and rural places, is barely notable at periurban locations and is practically lost at urban sites."
10.5061/dryad.r5v40,open,Data from: Fine-mapping nicotine resistance loci in Drosophila using a multiparent advanced generation inter-cross population,"Animals in nature are frequently challenged by toxic compounds, from those that occur naturally in plants as a defense against herbivory, to pesticides used to protect crops. On exposure to such xenobiotic substances, animals mount a transcriptional response, generating detoxification enzymes and transporters that metabolize and remove the toxin. Genetic variation in this response can lead to variation in the susceptibility of different genotypes to the toxic effects of a given xenobiotic. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to dissect the genetic basis of larval resistance to nicotine, a common plant defense chemical and widely used addictive drug in humans. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the trait using the DSPR (Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource), a panel of multiparental advanced intercross lines. Mapped QTL collectively explain 68.4% of the broad-sense heritability for nicotine resistance. The two largest-effect loci—contributing 50.3 and 8.5% to the genetic variation—map to short regions encompassing members of classic detoxification gene families. The largest QTL resides over a cluster of ten UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) genes, while the next largest QTL harbors a pair of cytochrome P450 genes. Using RNA-seq we measured gene expression in a pair of DSPR founders predicted to harbor different alleles at both QTL and showed that Ugt86Dd, Cyp28d1, and Cyp28d2 had significantly higher expression in the founder carrying the allele conferring greater resistance. These genes are very strong candidates to harbor causative, regulatory polymorphisms that explain a large fraction of the genetic variation in larval nicotine resistance in the DSPR."

To evaluate whether this finding is an artifact produced by CSD, we used analytic synthetic data. Using the multi-tensor model, two sets of synthetic dMRI data were created consisting of 100 voxels, each with two tensors crossing at right angles. For each voxel, one tensor was modelled as an &ldquo;intact&rdquo; fiber bundle, following the DTI metrics observed in our experimental data (&lambda;∥=0.64 and &lambda;⟂=0.12 &times;10-3 mm&sup2;/s), while the other tensor was modelled as an &ldquo;injured&rdquo; fiber bundle (&lambda;∥=0.42 and &lambda;⟂=0.22 &times;10-3 mm&sup2;/s). &nbsp;Volume fractions were set as f=0.5 for both tensors. The multi-shell scheme to generate the synthetic signals consisted of 20 b=0 s/mm&sup2;, and 160 DWI volumes, consisting of 80 diffusion gradient orientations, each with two distinct b values, namely b=1000 and 3000 s/mm&sup2;.

10.5061/dryad.rm907,open,Data from: Toward synthesizing our knowledge of morphology: using ontologies and machine reasoning to extract presence/absence evolutionary phenotypes across studies,"The reality of larger and larger molecular databases and the need to integrate data scalably have presented a major challenge for the use of phenotypic data. Morphology is currently primarily described in discrete publications, entrenched in noncomputer readable text, and requires enormous investments of time and resources to integrate across large numbers of taxa and studies. Here we present a new methodology, using ontology-based reasoning systems working with the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB; kb.phenoscape.org), to automatically integrate large amounts of evolutionary character state descriptions into a synthetic character matrix of neomorphic (presence/absence) data. Using the KB, which includes more than 55 studies of sarcopterygian taxa, we generated a synthetic supermatrix of 639 variable characters scored for 1051 taxa, resulting in over 145,000 populated cells. Of these characters, over 76% were made variable through the addition of inferred presence/absence states derived by machine reasoning over the formal semantics of the source ontologies. Inferred data reduced the missing data in the variable character-subset from 98.5% to 78.2%. Machine reasoning also enables the isolation of conflicts in the data, that is, cells where both presence and absence are indicated; reports regarding conflicting data provenance can be generated automatically. Further, reasoning enables quantification and new visualizations of the data, here for example, allowing identification of character space that has been undersampled across the fin-to-limb transition. The approach and methods demonstrated here to compute synthetic presence/absence supermatrices are applicable to any taxonomic and phenotypic slice across the tree of life, providing the data are semantically annotated. Because such data can also be linked to model organism genetics through computational scoring of phenotypic similarity, they open a rich set of future research questions into phenotype-to-genome relationships."

Despite their useful attributes, there is still a need to optimize aspects of the synthesis and stability.  The seedless, synthetic method comprised of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) is a facile, rapid method, however, produces heteromorphic nanostars.  The modification of a HEPES method resulted in a silver-assisted, seedless gold nanostar synthesis method.  The nanostars resulting from this method were monodispersed, multi-branched and approximately 37nm + 2nm in diameter.  It proved to be a repeatable method that produced homogenous and robust nanostars.  Once functionalized with polyvinylpyrrolidone 10 000, the new nanostars were observed to be stable in various environments such as salt, ionic strength and cell culture medium.  In conclusion, the addition of the silver nitrate improved the morphology of the reported HEPES nanostars for the purpose of nanobiosensor development."

Here, we present a validated method that automatically tracks a swimming fish in three dimensions from multi-camera high-speed video. We use an optimisation procedure to fit a parameterised, morphology-based fish model to each set of video images. This results in a time sequence of position, orientation and body curvature. We post-process this data to derive additional kinematic parameters (e.g. velocities, accelerations) and propose an inverse-dynamics method to compute the resultant forces and torques during swimming. The presented method for quantifying 3D fish motion paves the way for future analyses of swimming biomechanics."
10.5061/dryad.f347f,open,Data from: Genetic variation in host plants influences the mate preferences of a plant-feeding insect,"Many species spend their lives in close association with other organisms, and the environments provided by those organisms can play an important role as causes of variation in phenotypes. When this is the case, the genotypes of the individuals constituting the environment may influence the phenotypes of individuals living in that environment. When these effects are between heterospecifics, interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) occur. Several studies have detected IIGEs, but whether IIGEs contribute to variation in sexually selected traits remains virtually unexplored. We assessed how mate preferences in a plant-feeding insect are influenced by the genotype of their host plant. We established clone lines of a sample of host plant genotypes constituting the background biotic environment for a random sample of insects that we reared on them. We found that the insects' mate preferences varied according to the clone line on which they developed. These results demonstrate that genetic variation in host plants has cross-trophic consequences on a trait that has strong effects on fitness and interpopulation dynamics such as diversification in communication systems. We discuss how IIGEs on mate preferences may influence the way in which selection acts, including the maintenance of variation and the promotion of evolutionary divergence."

<p>This dataset must be used in conjunction with the NoLimit software package (https://zenodo.org/record/5512805).</p>

<p>Both the software and dataset allow the prediction of synthetic seismic waveforms for SS and PP-precursors from mineral physics models, as well as their processing for reconstructing the surface of seismic boundaries associated with major mineralogical phase transitions in the Earth&rsquo;s mantle (namely, the 410-km and 660-km depth discontinuities).</p>

<p>For technical reasons (storage and quick access), the catalog is downsampled with respect to the one in Waszek et al. (2021), and it is provided with the HDF5 format. For more advanced applications such as changing mantle composition, or generating waveforms for deeper earthquakes, please contact Benoit Tauzin (benoit.tauzin@univ-lyon1.fr) and Lauren Waszek (lauren.waszek@jcu.edu.au).</p>

<p>* A fixed mantle composition, which is a mechanical mixture of basalt and harzburgite with a fraction of basalt f=0.2.<br>
* A downsampled catalog of synthetic waveforms for event depths between 0 and 80 km by step of 10 km (enough for reproducing the processing of observed SS and PP precursors waveforms).<br>
* Adiabatic temperature gradients with potential temperature Tpot between 1200 and 2100 K by step of 100 K.</p>

10.25740/wv398fc4383,open,Next Generation Spacecraft Pose Estimation Dataset (SPEED+),"<p>SPEED+ is the next-generation dataset for spacecraft pose estimation with specific emphasis on the robustness of Machine Learning (ML) models across the domain gap. Similar to its predecessor, SPEED+ consists of images of the Tango spacecraft from the PRISMA mission. SPEED+ consists of three different domains of imageries from two distinct sources. The first source is the <strong>OpenGL-based Optical Stimulator camera emulator</strong> software of <a href=""https://damicos.people.stanford.edu"">Stanford&rsquo;s Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB)</a>, which is used to create the synthetic domain comprising 59,960 synthetic images. The labeled synthetic domain is split into 80:20 train/validation sets and is intended to be the main source of training of an ML model.</p>

<p>The second source is the&nbsp;<strong>Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON)&nbsp;</strong>facility at SLAB, which is used to generate two simulated Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) domains with different sourcesof illumination: lightbox and sunlamp. Specifically, these two domains are constructed using realistic illumination conditions using lightboxes with diffuser plates for albedo simulation and a sun lamp to mimic direct high-intensity homogeneous light from the Sun.</p>

<p>Compared to synthetic imagery, they capture corner cases, stray lights, shadowing, and visual effects in general which are not easy to obtain through computer graphics. The lightbox and sunlamp domains are <strong>unlabeled</strong> and thus intendeded mainly for testing, representing a typical scenario in developing a spaceborne ML model in which the labeled images from the target space domain are not available prior to deployment.</p>

<p>SPEED+ is made publicly available to the&nbsp;aerospace community and beyond as part of the <strong>second international Satellite Pose Estimation Competition (SPEC2021)</strong> co-hosted by SLAB and the <a href=""https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/"">Advanced Concepts Team (ACT)</a> of the <a href=""https://esa.int"">European Space Agency</a>.</p>

<p>The construction of the TRON testbed was partly funded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) through the Defense University Research InstrumentationProgram (DURIP) contract FA9550-18-1-0492, titled High-Fidelity Verification and Validation of Spaceborne Vision-Based Navigation. The SPEED+ dataset was&nbsp;created using the TRON testbed by SLAB at Stanford University. The post-processing of the raw images was&nbsp;reviewed by ACT to meet the quality requirement of SPEC2021.</p>

10.5061/dryad.15v00,open,Data from: Allelic diversity for neutral markers retains a higher adaptive potential for quantitative traits than expected heterozygosity,"The adaptive potential of a population depends on the amount of additive genetic variance for quantitative traits of evolutionary importance. This variance is a direct function of the expected frequency of heterozygotes for the loci which affect the trait (QTL). It has been argued, but not demonstrated experimentally, that long-term response to selection is more dependent on QTL allelic diversity than on QTL heterozygosity. Conservation programmes, aimed at preserving this variation, usually rely on neutral markers rather than on quantitative traits for making decisions on management. Here, we address, both through simulation analyses and experimental studies with Drosophila melanogaster, the question of whether allelic diversity for neutral markers is a better indicator of a high adaptive potential than expected heterozygosity. In both experimental and simulation studies, we established synthetic populations for which either heterozygosity or allelic diversity was maximized using information from QTL (simulations) or unlinked neutral markers (simulations and experiment). The synthetic populations were selected for the quantitative trait to evaluate the evolutionary potential provided by the two optimization methods. Our results show that maximizing the number of alleles of a low number of markers implies higher responses to selection than maximizing their heterozygosity."

<p>The synthetic set is composed of 10 sec audio clips generated with <a href=""https://github.com/justinsalamon/scaper"">Scaper</a> [5]. The foreground events are obtained from FSD. Each event audio clip was verified manually to ensure that the sound quality and the event-to-background ratio were sufficient to be used an isolated event. We also verified that the event was actually dominant in the clip and we controlled if the event onset and offset are present in the clip. Each selected clip was then segmented when needed to remove silences before and after the event and between events when the file contained multiple occurrences of the event class.</p>

10.5061/dryad.fj6q573vn,open,Data from: Herbivory may mediate the effects of nutrients on the dominance of alien plants,"<p>1. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of nutrient availability and fluctuations therein for invasion success of alien plants. Others also highlighted the role of herbivores in invasion success. However, how herbivory and the level and fluctuations in nutrient availability interact in driving alien plant invasion into native communities remains largely unexplored.</p>

<p>2. We grew eight invasive alien species as target species in pot-mesocosms with five different synthetic native communities in a three-factorial design with two levels of nutrient availability (low <i>vs</i> high), two levels of nutrient fluctuation (constant <i>vs</i> pulsed) and two levels of herbivory (with <i>vs</i> without).</p>

<p>3. The relative biomass production of the alien target plants decreased in response to an increase in nutrient availability, and increased in response to the presence of herbivores. Furthermore, herbivory could interact with changes in nutrient availability and nutrient fluctuations to affect the dominance of the alien target species (a marginally significant interaction; 90% CIs: [0.005, 0.176]).</p>

<p>4. Synthesis: Our multispecies experiment indicates that herbivory could mediate the interactive effect of nutrient enrichment and variability in nutrient supply on invasion of alien plants into native communities. Therefore, we recommend that studies testing the fluctuating resources hypothesis should also consider interactive effect of other trophic levels.</p>"

<p>A series of synthetic data sets that reproduce different behaviour characteristics of migrating neutrophils were generated in MATLAB. The data sets consisted of six artificial neutrophils that travelled along paths that presented different conditions of tortuosity, times to activation and proximity to other neutrophils during 98 time frames.</p>

<p>Numerous data sets of neutrophils in zebrafish were carefully observed before setting the characteristics. Six trajectories were manually determined by setting the row, column positions of the centroids at every time point for 98 time frames. Each trajectory was designed so that it would represent different neutrophil behaviours: some trajectories were very oriented and had movements with uniform distance between time frames, whilst others were less uniform and would move at different velocities, some were tortuous whilst others were straight. The trajectories of cells 1 and 2 collided several times in the second half of the time frames whilst cells 3 and 4 collided at the beginning of the movement. Cell 6 migrated without meandering and then stopped at the end (which represents the wound area of an inflammation-based experiment) whilst 5 presented a delayed activation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each time frame consisted of 11 slices of z-stack each with 275 x 275 pixels, where the neutrophils were formed by <strong>irregular shapes </strong>(sum of Gaussians) and <strong>Poisson Noise</strong> (check the corresponding sets with regular shapes, i.e. Gaussians with Gaussian noise plus another set with a <strong>single large neutrophil</strong> and Poisson noise) distributions of higher intensities than the background. The orientation of the Poisson varied according to the displacement of the artificial neutrophils,&nbsp;<em>i.e.</em>they were round when the cells were static, or elongated when in movement. The tracks with the Shapes were saved as the&nbsp;<em>gold standard</em> and five different data sets were generated by adding varying levels of white Poisson noise resulting in data sets with distributions with increasing similarity between the neutrophils and the background reflected by the decreasing values of the Bhattacharyya Distance (1.61, 1.25, 1, 0.66, 0.45) as defined by Coleman 1979.</p>

10.5061/dryad.f8c58,open,Data from: Does high relatedness promote cheater-free multicellularity in synthetic lifecycles?,"The evolution of multicellularity is one of the key transitions in evolution and requires extreme levels of cooperation between cells. However, even when cells are genetically identical, non-cooperative cheating mutants can arise that cause a breakdown in cooperation. How then, do multicellular organisms maintain cooperation between cells? A number of mechanisms that increase relatedness amongst cooperative cells have been implicated in the maintenance of cooperative multicellularity including single cell bottlenecks and kin recognition. In this study we explore how relatively simple biological processes such as growth and dispersal can act to increase relatedness and promote multicellular cooperation. Using experimental populations of pseudo-organisms, we found that manipulating growth and dispersal of clones of a social amoeba to create high levels of relatedness was sufficient to prevent the spread of cheating mutants. By contrast cheaters were able to spread under low relatedness conditions. Most surprisingly, we saw the largest increase in cheating mutants under an experimental treatment that should create intermediate levels of relatedness. This is because one of the factors raising relatedness, structured growth, also causes high vulnerability to growth rate cheaters."
10.5061/dryad.8jj12,open,Data from: Two-scale dispersal estimation for biological invasions via synthetic likelihood,"Biological invasions reshape environments and affect the ecological and economic welfare of states and communities. Such invasions advance on multiple spatial scales, complicating their control. When modeling stochastic dispersal processes, intractable likelihoods and autocorrelated data complicate parameter estimation. As with other approaches, the recent synthetic likelihood framework for stochastic models uses summary statistics to reduce this complexity; however, it additionally provides usable likelihoods, facilitating the use of existing likelihood-based machinery. Here, we extend this framework to parameterize multi-scale spatio-temporal dispersal models and compare existing and newly developed spatial summary statistics to characterize dispersal patterns. We provide general methods to evaluate potential summary statistics and present a fitting procedure that accurately estimates dispersal parameters on simulated data. Finally, we apply our methods to quantify the short and long range dispersal of Chagas disease vectors in urban Arequipa, Peru, and assess the feasibility of a purely reactive strategy to contain the invasion."

10.5061/dryad.cvdncjt3v,open,Behavioral interactions between bacterivorous nematodes and predatory bacteria in a synthetic community,"<p>Theory and empirical studies in metazoans predict that apex predators should shape the behavior and ecology of mesopredators and prey at lower trophic levels. Despite the ecological importance of microbial communities, few studies of predatory microbes examine such behavioral responses and the multiplicity of trophic interactions. Here, we sought to assemble a three-level microbial food chain and to test for behavioral interactions between the predatory nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and the predatory social bacterium <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i> when cultured together with two basal prey bacteria that both predators can eat—<i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</i>. We found that &gt;90% of <i>C. elegans</i> worms failed to interact with <i>M. xanthus </i>even<i> </i>when it was the only potential prey species available<i>, </i>whereas most worms were attracted to pure patches of <i>E. coli </i>and <i>F. johnsoniae. </i>In addition,<i> M. xanthus</i> altered nematode predatory behavior on basal prey, repelling <i>C. elegans</i> from two-species patches that would be attractive without <i>M. xanthus</i>, an effect similar to that of <i>C. elegans</i> pathogens. The nematode also influenced the behavior of the bacterial predator: <i>M. xanthus</i> increased its predatory swarming rate in response to <i>C. elegans </i>in a manner dependent both on basal-prey identity and on worm density. Our results suggest that <i>M. xanthus</i> is an unattractive prey for some soil nematodes and is actively avoided when other prey are available. Most broadly, we found that nematode and bacterial predators mutually influence one another's predatory behavior, with likely consequences for coevolution within complex microbial food webs.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.vs644,open,Data from: Geckos as springs: mechanics explain across-species scaling of adhesion,"One of the central controversies regarding the evolution of adhesion concerns how adhesive force scales as animals change in size, either among or within species. A widely held view is that as animals become larger, the primary mechanism that enables them to climb is increasing pad area. However, prior studies show that much of the variation in maximum adhesive force remains unexplained, even when area is accounted for. We tested the hypothesis that maximum adhesive force among pad-bearing gecko species is not solely dictated by toepad area, but also depends on the ratio of toepad area to gecko adhesive system compliance in the loading direction, where compliance (C) is the change in extension (Δ) relative to a change in force (F) while loading a gecko's adhesive system (C = dΔ/dF). Geckos are well-known for their ability to climb on a range of vertical and overhanging surfaces, and range in mass from several grams to over 300 grams, yet little is understood of the factors that enable adhesion to scale with body size. We examined the maximum adhesive force of six gecko species that vary in body size (~2–100 g). We also examined changes between juveniles and adults within a single species (Phelsuma grandis). We found that maximum adhesive force and toepad area increased with increasing gecko size, and that as gecko species become larger, their adhesive systems become significantly less compliant. Additionally, our hypothesis was supported, as the best predictor of maximum adhesive force was not toepad area or compliance alone, but the ratio of toepad area to compliance. We verified this result using a synthetic ""model gecko"" system comprised of synthetic adhesive pads attached to a glass substrate and a synthetic tendon (mechanical spring) of finite stiffness.

The details are summarized below: [Syn-2] contains 14 pairwise (2-way) synthetic models without constraints. These are shown in the leftmost column of Table I.  These models are benchmarks that have been used both to compare mathematical constructions as well as search based techniques [2], [10], [11], [18], [32]. We take these from Table 7 from the paper by Garvin et al.  [2]. [Syn-3] contains 15 3-way synthetic models without constraints.  These are shown in the second column of Table I. These models are benchmarks that have been used for mathematical constructions and search [10], [33], [34]. We take these from Table 7 from the paper by Garvin et al. [2]. [Syn-C2] contains 30 2-way synthetic models with constraints (see Table I, rightmost two columns). These models were designed to simulate configurations with constraints in real-world programs, generated by Cohen et al. [35] and adopted in follow-up research by Garvin et al. [2], [25]. [Real-1] contains real-world models from a recent benchmark created by Segall et al. [21], shown in Table II. There are 20 CIT problems in this subject set, generated by or for IBM customers. The 20 problems cover a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, healthcare, storage and banking systems. [Real-2] contains 6 real-world constrained subjects shown in Table II, which have been widely studied in the literature [2], [25], [30], [35], [36]. The TCAS model was first presented by Kuhn et al. [36]. TCAS is a traffic collision avoidance system from the ‘Siemens’ suite [37]. The rest of the models in this subject set were introduced by Cohen et al. [30], [35]. SPIN-S and SPIN-V are two components for model simulation and model verification. GCC is a well known compiler system from the GNU Project. Apache is a web server application and Bugzilla is a web-based bug tracking system.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.4g1t4ht,open,Data from: Controlling invasive rodents via synthetic gene drive and the role of polyandry,"House mice are a major ecosystem pest, particularly threatening island ecosystems as a non-native invasive species. Rapid advances in synthetic biology offer new avenues to control pest species for biodiversity conservation. Recently, a synthetic sperm killing gene drive construct called t-Sry has been proposed as a means to eradicate target mouse populations due to a lack of females. A factor that has received little attention in the discussion surrounding such drive applications is polyandry. Previous research has demonstrated that sperm killing drivers are extremely damaging to a male's sperm competitive ability. Here we examine the importance of this effect on the t-Sry system using a theoretical model. We find that polyandry substantially hampers the spread of t-Sry such that release efforts have to be increased 3- to 6-fold for successful eradication. We discuss the implications of our finding for pest potential control programs, the risk of drive spread beyond the target population, and the emergence of drive resistance. Our work highlights that a solid understanding of the forces that determine drive dynamics in a natural setting are key for successful drive application, and that exploring the natural diversity of gene drives may inform effective gene drive design."

10.5061/dryad.s7t47,open,Data from: Infants prefer the faces of strangers or mothers to morphed faces: an uncanny valley between social novelty and familiarity,"The ""uncanny valley"" response is a phenomenon involving the elicitation of a negative feeling and subsequent avoidant behaviour in human adults and infants as a result of viewing very realistic humanlike robots or computer avatars. It is hypothesised that this uncanny feeling occurs because the realistic synthetic characters elicit the concept of ""human"" but fail to satisfy it. Such violations of our normal expectations regarding social signals generate a feeling of unease. This conflict-induced uncanny valley between mutually exclusive categories (human and synthetic agent) raises a new question: could an uncanny feeling be elicited by other mutually exclusive categories, such as familiarity and novelty? Given that infants prefer both familiarity and novelty in social objects, we address this question as well as the associated developmental profile. Using the morphing technique and a preferential-looking paradigm, we demonstrated uncanny valley responses of infants to faces of mothers (i.e., familiarity) and strangers (i.e., novelty). Furthermore, this effect strengthened with the infant's age. We excluded the possibility that infants detect and avoid traces of morphing. This conclusion follows from our finding that the infants equally preferred strangers' faces and the morphed faces of two strangers. These results indicate that an uncanny valley between familiarity and novelty may accentuate the categorical perception of familiar and novel objects."
10.5061/dryad.vp5b7,open,Data from: Alarming features: birds use specific acoustic properties to identify heterospecific alarm calls,"Vertebrates that eavesdrop on heterospecific alarm calls must distinguish alarms from sounds that can safely be ignored, but the mechanisms for identifying heterospecific alarm calls are poorly understood. While vertebrates learn to identify heterospecific alarms through experience, some can also respond to unfamiliar alarm calls that are acoustically similar to conspecific alarm calls. We used synthetic calls to test the role of specific acoustic properties in alarm call identification by superb fairy wrens, Malurus cyaneus. Individuals fled more often in response to synthetic calls with peak frequencies closer to that of conspecific calls, even if other acoustic features were dissimilar to that of fairy-wren calls. Further, they then spent more time in cover following calls that had both peak frequencies and frequency modulation rates closer to natural fairy-wren means. Thus, fairy wrens use similarity in specific acoustic properties to identify alarms and adjust a two-stage antipredator response. Our study reveals how birds respond to heterospecific alarm calls without experience, and together with previous work using playback of natural calls shows that both acoustic similarity and learning are important for interspecific eavesdropping. More generally, this work reconciles contrasting views on the importance of alarm signal structure and learning in recognition of heterospecific alarms."

10.5061/dryad.k129c,open,Data from: Minimizing polymerase biases in metabarcoding,"DNA metabarcoding is an increasingly popular method to characterize and quantify biodiversity in environmental samples. Metabarcoding approaches simultaneously amplify a short, variable genomic region, or ""barcode"", from a broad taxonomic group via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using universal primers that anneal to flanking conserved regions. Results of these experiments are reported as occurrence data, which provide a list of taxa amplified from the sample, or relative abundance data, which measure the relative contribution of each taxon to the overall composition of amplified product. The accuracy of both occurrence and relative abundance estimates can be affected by a variety of biological and technical biases. For example, taxa with larger biomass may be better represented in environmental samples than those with smaller biomass. Here, we explore how polymerase choice, a potential source of technical bias, might influence results in metabarcoding experiments. We compared potential biases of six commercially available polymerases using a combination of mixtures of amplifiable synthetic sequences and real sedimentary DNA extracts. We find that polymerase choice can affect both occurrence and relative abundance estimates, and that the main source of this bias appears to be polymerase preference for sequences with specific GC contents. We further recommend an experimental approach for metabarcoding based on results of our synthetic experiments."

A no-N treatment was used as control and calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) as synthetic mineral fertilizer. After 100 days of incubation, the addition of PS and LFD resulted in a net N mineralization rate of 10.6 &plusmn; 0.3% and 20.6 &plusmn; 0.4% of the total applied N, respectively. The addition of CAN showed no significant net mineralization or immobilization (net N release 96 &plusmn; 6%). In the pot experiment under vegetation, all fertilized treatments caused N immobilization with a negative net N mineralization rate of &minus;51 &plusmn; 11%, &minus;9 &plusmn; 4%, and &minus;27 &plusmn; 10% of the total applied N in CAN, PS, and LFD treatments, respectively. Compared to the pot experiment, the laboratory incubation without vegetation may have overestimated the N value of biobased fertilizers. Vegetation resulted in a lower estimation of available N from fertilizers, probably due to intensified competition with soil microbes or increased N loss via denitrification.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.xksn02vf4,open,Altering transcription factor binding reveals comprehensive transcriptional kinetics of a basic gene,"<p>Transcription is a vital process activated by transcription factor (TF) binding. The active gene releases a burst of transcripts before turning inactive again. While the basic course of transcription is well understood, it is unclear how binding of a TF affects the frequency, duration and size of a transcriptional burst. We systematically varied the residence time and concentration of a synthetic TF and characterized the transcription of a synthetic reporter gene by combining single molecule imaging, single molecule RNA-FISH, live transcript visualisation and analysis with a novel algorithm, Burst Inference from mRNA Distributions (BIRD). For this well-defined system, we found that TF binding solely affected burst frequency and variations in TF residence time had a stronger influence than variations in concentration. This enabled us to device a model of gene transcription, in which TF binding triggers multiple successive steps before the gene transits to the active state and actual mRNA synthesis is decoupled from TF presence. We quantified all transition times of the TF and the gene, including the TF search time and the delay between TF binding and the onset of transcription. Our quantitative measurements and analysis revealed detailed kinetic insight, which may serve as basis for a bottom-up understanding of gene regulation.</p>"

As a result, there has been limited investigation into deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies. We detail demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information derived from publicly available information on deceased cases in SSA and, for cases in Burkina Faso, from aggregate records at the Center Hospitalier Universitaire de Tengandogo. Logistic regression was conducted on a synthetic case population to evaluate the adjusted odds of survival for patients receiving oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma, based on therapeutic effectiveness observed for other respiratory illnesses. Across SSA, deceased cases have been predominantly male and over 50 years of age. After adjustment for sex, age, and underlying conditions, the odds of mortality among cases in the synthetic population not receiving oxygen therapy was significantly higher than those receiving oxygen (OR: 2.07; 95%CI: 1.56-2.75). Cases receiving convalescent plasma had 50% reduced odds of mortality (95%CI: 0.24-0.93).<strong> </strong>Investment in sustainable oxygen therapy could reduce COVID-19 deaths in SSA.

10.5061/dryad.m64hs,open,Data from: Disruption of foraging by a dominant invasive species to decrease its competitive ability,"Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity when dominant within their newly established habitat. The globally distributed Argentine ant Linepithema humile has been reported to break the trade-off between interference and exploitative competition, achieve high population densities, and overpower nests of many endemic ant species. We have used the sensitivity of the Argentine ant to the synthetic trail pheromone (Z)-9-hexadecanal to investigate species interactions for the first time. We predicted that disrupting Argentine ant trail following behaviour would reduce their competitive ability and create an opportunity for three other resident species to increase their foraging success. Argentine ant success in the control was reduced with increasing pheromone concentration, as predicted, but interactions varied among competing resident species. These behavioural variations provide an explanation for observed differences in foraging success of the competing resident species and how much each of these individual competitors can increase their foraging if the competitive ability of the dominant invader is decreased. The mechanism for the observed increase in resource acquisition of resident species appears to be a decrease in aggressive behaviour displayed by the Argentine ant, which may create an opportunity for other resident species to forage more successfully. Our demonstration of species interactions with trail pheromone disruption is the first known case of reduced dominance under a pheromone treatment in ants."
10.5061/dryad.q28b2,open,Data from: Are flies kind to kin? The role of intra- and inter-sexual relatedness in mediating reproductive conflict,"As individual success often comes at the expense of others, interactions between the members of a species are frequently antagonistic, especially in the context of reproduction. In theory, this conflict may be reduced in magnitude when kin interact, as cooperative behaviour between relatives can result in increased inclusive fitness. Recent tests of the potential role of cooperative behaviour between brothers in Drosophila melanogaster have proved to be both exciting and controversial. We set out to replicate these experiments, which have profound implications for the study of kin selection and sexual conflict, and to expand upon them by also examining the potential role of kinship between males and females in reproductive interactions. While we did observe reduced fighting and courtship effort between competing brothers, contrary to previous studies we did not detect any fitness benefit to females as a result of the modification of male antagonistic behaviours. Furthermore, we did not observe any differential treatment of females by their brothers, as would be expected if the intensity of sexual conflict was mediated by kin selection. In the light of these results, we propose an alternative explanation for observed differences in male–male conflict and provide preliminary empirical support for this hypothesis."

<p><strong>Limitations of these models</strong></p>

<p><em>These models produce the best&nbsp;results for stars more massive than the Sun and older than about 0.5 Myr. </em>They employ the&nbsp;pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003477"">Siess et al.

10.5281/zenodo.5116420,open,3-D synthetic near surface data set with frequency-domain eletromagnetic induction data,"<p>Realistic&nbsp;three-dimensional&nbsp;exhaustive data set&nbsp;that mimics a near surface mining landfill deposit of waste fine-shaly sands. The data set is composed by petrophysical properties and frequency domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM) data and was created with the purpose of testing algorithms for near-surface modeling and characterization using electromagnetic data.</p>

<p>The set of petrophysical properties include porosity, water saturation, particle density and density. Each property corresponds to a single geostatistical realization. The three-dimensional&nbsp;model has a dimension of&nbsp;150 by&nbsp;200 by 4 meters&nbsp;(i.e.,&nbsp;length, width, depth)&nbsp;with a cell size of 0.5 m by 0.5 m by 0.1 m, respectively (grid size of 300 x 400 x 40). The model grid has 4.8 million cells.<br>
Porosity and particle density were modelled&nbsp;based on&nbsp;samples of fine-shaly sands&nbsp;collected at a mine tailing in Portugal for which we investigated porosity, specific weight and particle density. The results of these investigations were used to generate three-dimensional models of subsurface rock properties with unconditional stochastic sequential simulation (Deutsch &amp;&nbsp;Journel, 1998).<br>
Porosity was modelled with an omnidirectional&nbsp;spherical&nbsp;variogram model in the horizontal direction. The variogram model has a horizontal range of 10 m, a vertical range of&nbsp;1&nbsp;m and a nugget effect of 0.2&nbsp;% of the total variance of the data. This variogram model describes the expected spatial distribution of this property in the mine tailing.</p>

<p>To ensure&nbsp;plausibility between rock properties, particle density and water saturation models were generated with stochastic sequential co-simulation (Deutsch &amp;&nbsp;Journel, 1998) conditioned to the porosity model. For particle density we imposed an omnidirectional spherical variogram model in the horizontal direction with a range of 10 m, a vertical range of 1 m and a nugget effect of 0.2&nbsp;% of the total variance of the data, and the correlation between porosity and particle density from the lab measurements. For water saturation we imposed an omnidirectional spherical variogram model in the horizontal direction with a range of 16 m, a vertical range of 2 m and a nugget effect of 0.1 (%). For the co-simulation we imposed a correlation between porosity and water content, borrowed from Bhanbhro et al. (2013) and Dumont et al. (2016).</p>

<p>The pore fluid was defined as consisting in 80% of water and 20% of leachate, having a density of 0.99114 g/cm3 at a temperature of 30&ordm;C (Souza et al., 2014). The density was mathematically calculated from porosity and particle density models and the density of the pore fluid by using a simple volumetric average of the geological material densities and its relationship to porosity (Mavko et al., 2009), &nbsp;<em>d</em><sub><em>b</em>&nbsp;</sub>= (1 -&nbsp;&Oslash;) <em>d<sub>0</sub></em>&nbsp;&Oslash;&nbsp;<em>d<sub>fl</sub></em>&nbsp; , where <em>d<sub>0</sub></em>&nbsp;is the density of the mineral grains, <em>d<sub>fl</sub></em>&nbsp;is the density of the pore fluids, and &Oslash;&nbsp;is porosity.</p>

<p>The electrical&nbsp;conductivity&nbsp;(EC) was created based on the well-known empirical relationship of Archie&rsquo;s law (Archie, 1942). We first calculate electrical conductivity&nbsp;using the following equation, <em>R<sub>t</sub></em> = <em>a</em> <em>S<sub>w</sub><sup>-n</sup></em>&nbsp;&Oslash;<sup><em>-m</em></sup> <em>R<sub>w</sub></em>&nbsp; , where <em>a</em>&nbsp;is the tortuosity constant, assumed as 0.88, <em>S<sub>w</sub></em>&nbsp;is the water saturation, <em>n</em> is the saturation exponent, assumed as 2, &Oslash;&nbsp;is the porosity, <em>m</em> is the cementation exponent, assumed as 1.37, and <em>R<sub>w</sub></em>&nbsp;is the electrical resistivity of the pore fluid, assumed as 0.25. From the lithology and range of porosity values of the mining landfill model, the values of <em>a</em>, <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> were defined from Keller (1987). The electrical resistivity of the pore fluid was defined based on its composition and density (Keller, 1987).&nbsp;The EC was calculated based on Archie&acute;s second law (Archie, 1942), where conductivity of the partially saturated rock (<em>c<sub>t</sub></em>) is the inverse of its resistivity (<em>R<sub>t</sub></em>),&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>c<sub>t</sub></em>&nbsp;= 1 / <em>R<sub>t&nbsp;</sub></em>&nbsp; (Mavko et al., 2009).</p>

<p>Since the relationship between magnetic minerals and the magnetic properties of the rocks depends primarily of the composition and grain size of them (Butler, 2005), the magnetic&nbsp;susceptibility&nbsp;(MS) was modelled using the common range of magnetic&nbsp;susceptibility&nbsp;for unconsolidated sediments (Hudson et al., 1999) with unconditional stochastic sequential simulation (Deutsch &amp;&nbsp;Journel, 1998), imposing an omnidirectional spherical variogram model in the horizontal direction with a range of&nbsp;20 m,&nbsp;a vertical range of&nbsp;4&nbsp;m and a nugget effect of 0.1 % of the total variance.</p>

<p>From the resulting&nbsp;three-dimensional&nbsp;models of EC and MS, we retrieved nine&nbsp;equally spaced boreholes along the same yz profile. These borehole data might be used as experimental data for modelling workflows, including geophysical inversion.</p>

<p>FDEM data, both the in-phase (IP) and quadrature-phase (QP),&nbsp;were&nbsp;calculated using a 1-D forward model (Hanssens&nbsp;et al., 2019). The acquisition configuration replicates one of the most common sensors for FDEM near-surface surveys, namely the DUALEM-421S (DUALEM Inc., Milton, Canada). It considers two loop-loop coil orientations, a horizontal coplanar (HCP) and a perpendicular one (PRP), with the normal 3 offsets per coil orientation for this equipment, 1, 2 and 4 meters for HCP, and 1.1, 2.1 and 4.1 meters for PRP, plus an extra offset per coil orientation, 10 meters for HCP and 10.1 meters for PRP, ensuring a theoretical larger depth of investigation. The FDEM data were calculated defining the operating frequency of the sensor as 9000 Hz, with an elevation to the surface of 0.15 m.</p>"

<p>This dataset consists of simulated anechoic first order Ambisonic (FOA) format recordings with moving point sources each in 2D spherical space represented with azimuth and elevation angles. The dataset consists of three sub-datasets with a) maximum one temporally overlapping sound events, b) maximum two temporally overlapping sound events, and c) maximum three temporally overlapping sound events. Each of the sub-datasets has three cross-validation splits, that consists of 240 recordings of about 30 seconds long for training split and 60 recordings of the same length for the testing split. For each recording, the metadata file with the same name consists of the sound event name, the temporal onset and offset time (in seconds), starting spatial location and directional spatial location in azimuth and elevation angles (in degrees), angular velocity of motion, and distance from the microphone (in meters).</p>

<p>The isolated sound events were taken from the DCASE 2016 task 2 dataset. This dataset consists of 11 sound event classes such as Clearing throat, Coughing, Door knock, Door slam, Drawer, Human laughter, Keyboard, Keys (put on a table), Page turning, Phone ringing and Speech. Every event is assigned a spatial trajectory on an arc with a constant distance from the microphone (in the range 1-10 m) and moving with a constant angular velocity for its duration. Due to the choice of the ambisonic spatial recording format, the steering vectors for a plane wave source or point source in the far field are frequency-independent. Hence, there is no need for a time-variant convolution or impulse response interpolation scheme as the source is moving; the spatial encoding of the monophonic signal was done sample-by-sample using instantaneous ambisonic encoding vectors for the respective DOA of the moving source. The synthesized trajectories in the dataset vary in both azimuth and elevation and are simulated to have a constant angular velocity in the range [-90, 90]/s with 10-degree/s steps.</p>

<p>The license of the dataset can be found in the LICENSE file. The rest of the nine zip files consists of datasets for a given split and overlap.

<p>A series of synthetic data sets that reproduce different behaviour characteristics of migrating neutrophils were generated in MATLAB. The data sets consisted of one artificial neutrophil that travelled along a path that presented different conditions of tortuosity, times to activation during 98 time frames.</p>

<p>Numerous data sets of neutrophils in zebrafish were carefully observed before setting the characteristics. One trajectory was manually determined by setting the row, column positions of the centroid at every time point for 98 time frames. The trajectory was designed so that it would represent different neutrophil behaviours: some moments were very oriented and had movements with uniform distance between time frames, whilst others were less uniform and would move at different velocities, some were tortuous whilst others were straight.</p>

<p>Each time frame consisted of 11 slices of z-stack each with 275 x 275 pixels, where the neutrophil was formed by Gaussian distributions of higher intensities than the background and <strong>Poisson noise </strong>(check the corresponding sets with <strong>smaller </strong>regular shapes with Gaussian noise and irregular shapes with Poisson noise).</p>

10.5061/dryad.ttdz08m0f,open,Discovery of thermostable fluorescently responsive glucose biosensors by structure-assisted function extrapolation,"<p>Accurate assignment of protein function from sequence remains a fascinating and difficult challenge.   The periplasmic binding protein (PBP) superfamily present an interesting case of function prediction, because they are both ubiquitous in prokaryotes, and they tend to diversify through gene duplication ""explosions"" that can lead to large numbers of paralogs in a genome.  An engineered version of the moderately thermostable glucose-binding PBP from <i>Escherichia coli</i> has been used successfully as a reagentless fluorescent biosensor both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.  To develop more robust sensors that meet the challenges of real-world applications, we report the discovery of thermostable homologs that retain a glucose-mediated conformationally coupled fluorescence response.  Accurately identifying a glucose-binding PBP homolog among closely related paralogs is challenging.  We demonstrate that a structure-based method that filters sequences by residues that bind glucose in an archetype structure is highly effective.  Using fully sequenced bacterial genomes we found that this filter reduced high paralog numbers to single hits in a genome, consistent with accurate separation of glucose binding from other functions.  We expressed engineered proteins for eight homologs, chosen to represent different degrees of sequence identity and tested their glucose-mediated fluorescence responses.  We accurately predicted the presence of glucose binding down to 31% sequence identity.  We also have successfully identified suitable candidates for next-generation robust, fluorescent glucose sensors.</p>"

Salinity comprises multiple anions and cations. While total concentrations are typically used to infer effects, individual ion concentrations and ion ratios are critical in determining effects. Moreover, estimates of toxicity from single species laboratory tests, may not accurately predict relative effects on populations, communities and ecosystems. Here we compare salinity increases from synthetic marine salts (SMS) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in an outdoor mesocosm experiment in south-eastern Australia. We found different effects of salt types on stream macroinvertebrates at the population, community, and ecosystem function levels, where similar effects were predicted from single species laboratory tests. Our results caution against the use of single species laboratory derived toxicological data to predict both environmentally safe salinity levels and the relative effects of different salt sources on freshwater biodiversity.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.4f4qrfj8h,open,Endocrine disruptors cause multigenerational and transgenerational epigenetic changes in fish exposed during early life,"<p>The inland silverside, <i>Menidia beryllina</i>, is a euryhaline fish and a model organism in ecotoxicology. We previously showed that exposure to picomolar (ng/L) levels of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cause a variety of effects in <i>M. beryllina</i>, from changes in gene expression to phenotypic alterations. Here we explore the potential for early life exposure to EDCs to modify the epigenome in silversides, with a focus on multi- and transgenerational effects. EDCs included contaminants of emerging concern (the pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin and the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel), as well as a commonly detected synthetic estrogen (ethinylestradiol), and a synthetic androgen (trenbolone) at exposure levels ranging from 3 to 10 ng/L. In a multigenerational experiment, we exposed parental silversides to EDCs from fertilization until 21 days post hatch (dph). Then we assessed DNA methylation patterns for three generations (F0, F1, and F2) in whole body larval fish using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We found significant ( = 0.05) differences in promoter and/or gene body methylation in treatment fish relative to controls for all EDCs and all generations indicating that both multigenerational (F1) and transgenerational (F2) effects that were caused by strict inheritance of DNA methylation alterations and the dysregulation of epigenetic control mechanisms. Using gene ontology and pathway analyses, we found enrichment in biological processes and pathways representative of growth and development, immune function, reproduction, pigmentation, epigenetic regulation, stress response and repair (including pathways important in carcinogenesis). Further, we found that a subset of potentially EDC responsive genes (EDCRGs) were differentially methylated across all treatments and generations and included hormone receptors, genes involved in steroidogenesis, prostaglandin synthesis, sexual development, DNA methylation, protein metabolism and synthesis, cell signaling, and neurodevelopment. The analysis of EDCRGs provided additional evidence that differential methylation is inherited by the offspring of EDC-treated animals, sometimes in the F2 generation that was never exposed. These findings show that low, environmentally relevant levels of EDCs can cause altered methylation in genes that are functionally relevant to impaired phenotypes documented in EDC-exposed animals and EDC exposure has the potential to affect epigenetic regulation in fish that have not been directly exposed.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.c3b75,open,Data from: Investigating a possible role for the bacterial signal molecules N-acylhomoserine lactones in Balanus improvisus cyprid settlement,"Increased settlement on bacterial biofilms has been demonstrated for a number of marine invertebrate larvae, but the nature of the cue(s) responsible is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that the bay barnacle Balanus improvisus utilises the bacterial signal molecules N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) as a cue for the selection of sites for permanent attachment. Single species biofilms of the AHL-producing bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas hydrophila and Sulfitobacter sp. BR1 were attractive to settling cypris larvae of Balanus improvisus. However, when AHL production was inactivated, either by mutation of the AHL synthetic genes or by expression of an AHL-degrading gene (aiiA), the ability of the bacteria to attract cyprids was abolished. In addition, cyprids actively explored biofilms of E. coli expressing recombinant AHL synthase genes, but not on E. coli that did not produce AHLs. Finally, concentrations of synthetic AHLs similar to those found within natural biofilms (5 µM) resulted in increased cyprid settlement. Thus, the attraction of B. improvisus larvae to biofilms appears to be mediated by AHL signalling bacteria in the laboratory.

10.5061/dryad.m37pvmd06,open,Incorporating hierarchical characters into phylogenetic analysis,"<p>Popular optimality criteria for phylogenetic trees focus on sequences of characters that are applicable to all the taxa. As studies grow in breadth, it can be the case that some characters are applicable for a portion of the taxa and inapplicable for others.  Past work has explored the limitations of treating inapplicable characters as missing data, noting that this strategy may favor trees where interval nodes are assigned impossible states, where the arrangement of taxa within subclades is unduly influenced by variation in distant parts of the tree, and/or where taxa that otherwise share most primary characters are grouped distantly. Approaches that avoid the first two problems have recently been proposed. Here, we propose an alternative approach which avoids all three problems. In the spirit of maximum parsimony, the proposed criterion seeks the phylogenetic tree with the minimal changes across any tree branch, but where changes are defined in terms of dissimilarity metrics that weigh the affects of inapplicable characters. The approach can accommodate binary, multistate, ordered, unordered, and polymorphic characters.  We give a polynomial-time algorithm, inspired by Fitch's algorithm, to score trees under a family of dissimilarity metrics, and prove its correctness.  We show that the resulting optimality criteria is computationally hard, by reduction to the NP-hardness of the maximum parsimony optimality criteria.  We demonstrate our approach using synthetic and empirical data sets and compare the results with other recently proposed methods for choosing optimal phylogenetic trees when the data includes inapplicable characters.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.kb110,open,Data from: Causes and consequences of individual variation in the extent of post-juvenile moult in the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus (Passeriformes: Paridae),"Moult, comprising the growth or replacement of feathers in birds, is an energetically demanding process. As a result, in many species, the extent of the post-juvenile moult can vary substantially. However, the reasons underlying this variation remain poorly understood, and the potential life-history consequences of variation in moult extent are even less clear. In the present study, we aimed to use individual-specific data to identify factors affecting the extent of the post-juvenile moult in a population of over 2500 blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus Linnaeus 1758, and to assess the consequences of individual variation in moult extent on reproduction in the first year of life. There was a substantial sex difference in post-juvenile moult extent, with males moulting more extensively than females. Putative immigrant birds had moulted on average less than those born locally. However, there was little evidence of carry-over effects of the natal environment on moult extent because we found no relationship between moult extent and fledging date or nestling mass. Evidence that moult extent, and hence feather brightness, affected subsequent reproductive success was limited. Moult extent had no effect on recruitment in males, although female recruits had moulted significantly less than nonbreeders. Because it was not influenced by features of the natal environment, moult extent may not be an honest signal of individual quality in C. caeruleus. As a result, the potential consequences of variation in moult extent for fitness are likely to be small."
10.5061/dryad.933bs,open,Data from: Log moisture capacity does not predict epixylic bryophyte growth under thinned and unthinned forest canopies,"1. Coarse woody debris (CWD) serves as habitat for diverse and rare taxa in forest systems. Because the abundance of mosses appears to be correlated with log size and stage of decay, many have suggested that CWD serves as a moisture reservoir, ensuring a humid microclimate and facilitating moss growth, but no one has tested this connection. Intact forest canopies are also thought to maintain humid conditions that benefit moss growth. If microclimatic regulation is the primary mechanism contributing to high moss abundance on CWD, then epixylic moss growth should increase with the capacity of the log moisture reservoir, and the importance of the reservoir size should increase with canopy opening. 2. Three types of synthetic logs, identical in size and shape but differing in moisture capacity, and two natural substrates, well-decayed birch and Thuja logs, were used to test the effects of log moisture capacity on growth of Dicranum flagellare under thinned and intact canopies of a spruce plantation over 20 months. 3. Surface humidity was positively associated with moisture capacity, but did not reach the water compensation point outside of precipitation events. Under a closed forest canopy, moss growth was negligible across all log types. Under an open forest canopy, moss growth was greater on natural substrates than synthetic ones, and negatively related to moisture capacity. CWD facilitates a sufficiently humid surface for only a short time after precipitation, presumably when a film of liquid water is maintained near the surface. 4. For Dicranum flagellare, canopy condition is a more accurate predictor of growth than CWD-moisture capacity; any beneficial properties of CWD appear to be lessened by a dense forest canopy (as in silvicultural plantations), probably because it reduces access to liquid water from precipitation. 5. We propose that the surface moisture availability of CWD depends on optimal depth of a ""resisting layer"" below the log surface, representing a tradeoff between water retention and loss (via percolation or runoff at extremely deep vs. shallow resisting layer depth). CWD may possess microclimate-regulating traits that benefit moss growth, but it does not appear to act as a moisture capacitor."

The C–H activation of 1 with in situ formed Pd(MeCN)4(BF4)2 has been studied and leads to a mixture of palladacycles, which were characterized by X-ray crystallography. The monomeric palladacycle LPdCl 6, where L-H = 1, has been synthesized, and tested in SM couplings of aryl bromides, where it showed moderate activity. Density functional theory and the atoms in molecules (AIM) method have been used to investigate the formation and bonding of 6, revealing a difference in the nature of the Pd–S and Pd–N bonds. It was found that S-coordination to the metal in the rate determining C–H bond activation step leads to better stabilization of the Pd(II) centre (by 13–28 kJ mol−1) than with N-coordination. This is attributed to the electron donating ability of the donor atoms determined by Bader charges. The AIM analysis also revealed that the Pd–N bonds are stronger than the Pd–S bonds influencing the stability of key intermediates in the palladacycle formation reaction pathway."

This allows to start sampling at the onset of each simulation instead of at the end of the first cycle. This change does impact the findings of the study.</li>
	<li>The sampled discharge files (Qout*.nc) where produced with an updated version of rrr_anl_spl_mod.py which now selects the time step at which a sample is retained using a slightly different approach.

10.5281/zenodo.6342553,open,Synthetic Data for Uplift Modeling and Heterogenous Treatment Effect with Known Counterfactuals and ITE,"<p>This dataset is designed and simulated for evaluating uplift modeling. The data generation process is based on a logistic regression model - no real data is included or used for generating this dataset.</p>

<p>This dataset has several signatures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It generates features with various patterns associated with the outcome variable and the causal effect (or treatment effect). Thus it is suitable for evaluating feature importance and model interpretation for uplift modeling.</li>
	<li>The true counterfactual outcomes under control and treatment are known for each user, as well as the true ITE (Individual treatment effect).</li>
</ul>

<p>This dataset consists of 50 trials (replicates with different random seeds), each trial with 20,000 samples and 36 features. The outcome variable is binary, which makes this dataset for classification problems. The samples are equally split for the control and treatment groups (10,000 samples in each group in each trial).</p>

<p>The generated data has three types of features: (1) uplift features influencing the treatment effect on the conversion probability; (2) classification features affecting the conversion probability but independent of the treatment effect; and (3) irrelevant features that are independent of both conversion probability and the treatment effect.</p>

<p>To simulate the relationship between uplift features and the treatment effect and classification features and outcome probability, we implement six types of association patterns in the data generation process: linear, quadratic, cubic, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), trigonometric function sine, and cosine.</p>

<p>In this data set, there are 36 features in total, including 10 classification features, 6 uplift features, and 20 irrelevant features.</p>

We also developed a disease progression velocity index.</p>
<p><strong>Design and setting:</strong> Retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data. The charts of consecutive COVID-19 patients discharged from the Reggio Emilia (Italy) ED (March 2 - March 31, 2020) were retrospectively examined. Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings at first ED admission were tested as predictive factors using multivariable logistic models. We divided CT extension by days from symptom onset to build a synthetic velocity index.</p>
<p><strong>Participants: </strong>450 patients discharged from the ED with diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Main outcome measure:</strong> ED readmission within 14 days, followed by hospitalization/death.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Of the discharged patients, 84 (18.7%) were readmitted to the ED and 61 (13.6%) were hospitalized and 10 (2.2%) died. Age (OR=1.05; 95% CI 1.03-1.08), Charlson Comorbidity Index 3 vs 0 (OR=11.61; 95% CI 1.76-76.58), days from symptom onset (OR for one day increase=0.81; 95% CI 0.73-0.90), and CT extension (OR for 1% increase=1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) were associated in a multivariable model for readmission with hospitalization/death. A 2-day lag velocity index was a strong predictor (OR for unit increase=1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.36); the model including this index resulted in less information loss.</p>

<p>Nanoparticle-polymer composites are important functional materials but structural control of their assembly is challenging. Owing to its crystalline internal structure and tunable nanoscale morphology, cellulose is promising polymer scaffold for templating such composite materials. Here, we show bottom-up synthesis of reducing end thiol-modified cellulose chains by iterative bi-enzymatic &beta;-1,4-glycosylation of 1-thio-&beta;-D-glucose (10 mM), to a degree of polymerization of &sim;8 and in a yield of &sim;41% on the donor substrate (&alpha;-D-glucose 1-phosphate, 100 mM). Synthetic cellulose oligomers self-assemble into highly ordered crystalline (cellulose allomorph II) material showing long (micrometers) and thin nanosheet-like morphologies, with thickness of 5&ndash;7 nm. Silver nanoparticles were attached selectively and well dispersed on the surface of the thiol-modified cellulose, in excellent yield (&ge; 95%) and high loading efficiency (&sim;2.2 g silver/g thiol-cellulose). Examined against&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, surface-patterned nanoparticles show excellent biocidal activity. Bottom-up approach by chemical design to a functional cellulose nanocomposite is presented.

In particular, the maximum likelihood estimates can exhibit bias and large variance for data sets with small sample sizes, which can result in estimated occupancy probabilities near 0 and 1 ('boundary estimates'). 2. In this paper, we explore strategies for estimating parameters based on maximizing a penalized likelihood. Penalized likelihood methods augment the usual likelihood with a penalty function that encodes information about what parameter values are undesirable. We introduce penalties for occupancy models that have analogues in ridge regression and Bayesian approaches, and we compare them to a penalty developed for occupancy models in prior work. 3. We examine the bias, variance and mean squared error of parameter estimates obtained from each method on synthetic data. Across all of the synthetic data sets, the penalized estimation methods had lower mean squared error than the maximum likelihood estimates. We also provide an example of the application of these methods to point counts of avian species. Penalized likelihood methods show similar improvements when tested using empirical bird point count data. 4. We discuss considerations for choosing among these methods when modelling occupancy. We conclude that penalized methods may be of practical utility for fitting occupancy models with small sample sizes, and we are releasing R code that implements these methods."

<p>Among these breakthroughs quality dataset is one of important key building blocks that can lead to success in model generalisation and deployment for data-driven deep neural networks. Particularly, synthetic data generation such as generative adversarial networks often requires relatively larger scale data than other supervised approaches. In addition, posing constrains such as geometrical facial constrains in fake face generation or consistent and radiometrically calibrated reflectances from satellite imagery commonly yield better results. We share NIR+RGB dataset that are re-processed from other two public datasets (nirscene and SEN12MS) and our own novel sweetpepper dataset to be able to timely adopt to other following studies.</p>

<p>We oversampled from original nirscene dataset at 10, 100, 200, and 400 ratios and total of 127k pair of images. For SEN12MS satellite multispectral dataset, we selected one largest subset; Summer (45k) and All seasons (180k). Our sweetpeppr dataset consists of 1,615 pairs of NIR+RGB images. We demonstrate these NIR+RGB datasets are sufficient to be used for synthetic NIR generation quantitatively and qualitatively.

The goal of this project was to detect quantitative trait loci using extremes from a large synthetic population, as well as a related recombinant inbred line mapping population for these two traits. Ten thousand individuals from a B73 × Mo17 noninbred population intermated for 14 generations (IBM Syn14) were grown at a density of approximately 16,500 plants ha−1. Flowering time and plant height were measured within this population. DNA was pooled from the 46 most extreme individuals from each distributional tail for each of the traits measured and used in bulk segregant analysis (BSA) sequencing. Allelic divergence at each of the ∼1.1 million SNP loci was estimated as the difference in allele frequencies between the selected extremes. Additionally, 224 intermated B73 × Mo17 recombinant inbred lines were concomitantly grown at a similar density adjacent to the large synthetic population and were assessed for flowering time and plant height. Using the BSA sequencing method, 14 and 13 genomic regions were identified for flowering time and plant height, respectively. Linkage mapping with the RIL population identified eight and three regions for flowering time and plant height, respectively. Of the regions identified, three colocalized between the two populations for flowering time and two colocalized for plant height. This study demonstrates the utility of using BSA sequencing for the dissection of complex quantitative traits important for production of lignocellulosic ethanol."

Traditional finite-fault tsunami source inversion methods suffer from the uncertainty of fault parameters or crustal rigidity. Moreover, the heavy computational burden of calculating Green&rsquo;s functions results in limited spatial resolution and hinders the real-time applicability of the traditional methods to tsunami early warning. In this work, we apply the adjoint-state full waveform inversion method to the tsunami source inversion. The benefits of the adjoint inversion are two folds: 1) independence of fault parameters, and 2) high computational efficiency, especially for dense tsunami arrays and high resolution grids. We valid this approach with synthetic tsunami sources, and apply it to the 2014 Chile-Iquique tsunami event. Both synthetic and real-data preliminary results show that the adjoint-state method is of high efficiency and high resolution, outperforming the traditional tsunami source inversions.&nbsp;</p>

10.5281/zenodo.3981252,open,Ultra-wideband SAR Tomography on asteroids : FDBP and Compressive Sensing datasets,"<p>Our knowledge of the internal structure of asteroids is currently indirect and relies on inferences from remote sensing observations of surfaces. However, it is fundamental for understanding small bodies&rsquo; history and for planetary defense missions. Radar observation of asteroids is the most mature technique available to characterize their inner structure, and Synthetic Aperture Radar Tomography (TomoSAR) allows 3D imaging by extending the synthetic aperture principle in the elevation direction. However, as the geometry of observation of small asteroids is complex, and TomoSAR studies have always been performed in the Earth observation geometry, TomoSAR results in a small body geometry must be simulated to assess the methods&rsquo; performances. Different tomography algorithms can be adopted, depending on the characteristics of the problem. While the Frequency Domain Back Projection (FDBP) is based on the correction of the&nbsp; Fourier transform of the received signal by an <em>ad-hoc</em> function built from the geometry of study, it can only retrieve the true position of the scatterers when applied along with ray-tracing methods, which are unreliable in the case of rough asteroid surfaces. Meanwhile, the Compressive Sensing (CS) is based on the compressive sampling theory, which relies on the hypothesis that few scatterers lie in the same direction from the subsurface. The CS can be used to retrieve the position of the scatterers, but its application in the small body geometry is questioned. Thus, both performances of the FDBP and the CS in a small body geometry are demonstrated, and the quality of the reconstruction is analyzed.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.5rk1851,open,Data from: The role of volatile plant secondary metabolites as pre-ingestive cues and potential toxins dictating diet selection by African elephants,"Understanding the factors driving diet selection represents one of the main thrusts of contemporary foraging ecology. Many studies have focussed on nutritional factors and anti-nutritional factors (such as tannins) that may describe diet selection of generalist mammalian herbivores, but these often do not explain the observed feeding patterns. Alternatively, generalist herbivores may be influenced by the presence, diversity, and/or concentration of toxins. Plant volatiles have been understudied, yet may play an important role in this context. We aimed to determine whether diet selection by African elephants is better correlated with the presence and concentration of toxic plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) than with nutritional or anti-nutritional factors. We also aimed to identify the specific aspects of the plant-odour profiles that were correlated with dietary selection, which could be used as a pre-ingestive cue for food selection. We found that elephant diet selection was not well described by crude protein, in vitro digestibility, tannin concentration, and total polyphenol concentration. Instead, the best predictors of elephant diet choice were the number and absolute (total) emissions of potentially toxic volatile PSMs, specifically monoterpenes. Elephants avoided plant species that emitted a wider diversity of volatile PSMs, had higher total emissions, and higher numbers and emissions of monoterpenes. This suggests that PSMs with a high propensity to become toxins, such as monoterpenes, are likely a better indicator for elephant diet avoidance than nutritional or anti-nutritional factors. Moreover, we demonstrated that elephants can differentiate between food items based on odour alone, specifically volatile monoterpenes, suggesting that these animals are relying on specific volatile cues emitted from plants to direct their foraging choices prior to ingesting selected plants."

10.5061/dryad.6tc06,open,Data from: Phylogenetic evidence from freshwater crayfishes that cave adaptation is not an evolutionary dead-end,"Caves are perceived as isolated, extreme habitats with a set of uniquely specialized biota, which long ago led to the idea that caves are 'evolutionary dead-ends.' This suggests that cave-adapted taxa may be doomed for extinction before they can diversify or transition to a more stable state. However, this hypothesis has not been explicitly tested in a phylogenetic framework with multiple independent cave-dwelling groups. Here we use the freshwater crayfish, a group with dozens of cave-dwelling species in multiple lineages, as a system to test this hypothesis. We consider historical patterns of lineage diversification and habitat transition as well as current patterns of geographic range size. We find that while cave-dwelling lineages have small relative range sizes and rarely transition back to the surface, they exhibit remarkably similar diversification patterns to those of other habitat types and appear to be able to maintain a diversity of lineages through time. This suggests that cave-adaptation is not a 'dead-end' for freshwater crayfish, which has positive implications for our understanding of biodiversity and conservation in cave habitats."

10.5061/dryad.8j60q,open,Data from: Synthesis of phylogeny and taxonomy into a comprehensive tree of life,"Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships that unite all lineages (the tree of life) is a grand challenge. The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable. To reconstruct a comprehensive tree of life, we therefore synthesized published phylogenies, together with taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips—the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics."

Continuous selection over some generations can then reduce the toxicity of the pollutant but also deplete the additive genetic variance for the tolerance and thereby slow down adaptation. One common pollutant that has been ecologically relevant for some time is 17alpha-ethynyestradiol (EE2), a synthetic compound of oral contraceptives since their market launch in the 1960s. EE2 is typically found in higher concentrations in rivers than in lakes. Recent experimental work revealed significant genetic variance for the tolerance to EE2 in two lake-spawning salmonid species but no such variance in river-spawning brown trout. We used another river-spawning salmonid, the European grayling <i>Thymallus thymallus</i>, to study the toxicity of an ecologically relevant concentration of EE2. We also used a full-factorial <i>in vitro</i> breeding design and singly rearing of 1,555 embryos and larvae of 40 sib groups to test whether there is additive genetic variance for the tolerance to this pollutant.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: We found that exposure to EE2 reduced larval growth after hatching, but contrary to what has been found in the other salmonids, there were no significant effects of EE2 on embryo growth and survival. We found additive genetic variance for embryo viability, i.e. heritability for fitness. However, there was no significant additive variance for the tolerance to EE2.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings support the hypothesis that continuous selection has reduced the toxicity of EE2 and depleted genetic variance for tolerance to this synthetic stressor.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.439934,open,Nanohydrogel Brushes for Switchable Underwater Adhesion - Dataset,"<p>Abstract of the related article: In nature, living systems commonly adopt the switchable friction/adhesion mechanism during locomotion. For example, geckos can move on ceilings, relying on the reversible attachment and detachment of their feet on substrate surfaces. Inspired by this scientists have used different materials to mimic natural dynamic friction/adhesion systems. However, synthetic systems usually cannot work in water environments and are also limited to single-contact interfaces, while nature has provided living systems with complex features to perform energy dissipation and adhere on multiple contact interfaces. Here, for the first time, we report the design, synthesis, and testing of a novel double-sided synthetic construct that relies on nanohydrogel brushes to provide simultaneous friction switching on each side of the membrane that separates the nanohydrogel fibers. This highly tunable response is linked to the swelling and shrinkage of the brushes in basic/acid media. Such a system shows three different friction states, which depend on the combination of pH control of the two membrane sides. Importantly, each side of the membrane can independently provide continuous but stable friction switching from high to ultralow friction coefficients in a wet environment under high load conditions. An in-depth theoretical study is performed to explore the mechanisms governing the hydration state responsible for the observed switching. This novel design opens a promising route for the development of new solutions for intelligent devices, which can adapt to multistimulus-responsive complex environments.</p>

Recent elucidation of a resistance endowing IAA16 mutation (G73N) in a key weed species kochia (<i>Bassia scoparia</i>), allows detailed characterization of the contribution of resistance alleles to weed fitness, both in the presence and absence of herbicides.<b> </b>Different G73N genotypes from a segregating resistant parental line (9425) were characterized for cross resistance to dicamba, 2,4-D and fluroxypyr, and changes on stem/leaf morphology and plant architecture. Plant competitiveness and dominance of the fitness effects was quantified through measuring biomass and seed production of three F<sub>2</sub> lines in two runs of glasshouse replacement series studies. G73N confers robust resistance to dicamba but only moderate to weak resistance to 2,4-D and fluroxypyr. G73N mutant plants displayed significant vegetative growth defects: 1) being 30-50% shorter with a more tumbling style plant architecture; 2) had thicker and more ovate (versus lanceolate and linear) leaf blades with lower photosynthesis efficiency, and 40-60% smaller stems with less developed vascular bundle systems. F<sub>2 </sub>mutant plants had impaired plant competitiveness, which produced up to 90% less biomass and seeds in the replacement series study. The pleiotropic effects of G73N was mostly semi-dominant (0.5) and fluctuated with the environments and traits measured. G73N is associated with significant vegetative growth defects and reduced competitiveness in synthetic auxin resistant kochia. Management practices should target resistant kochia's high vulnerability to competition to effectively contain the spread of resistance.</span></p>"

<p><em>Abstract</em></p>

<p>To date,&nbsp;approximately 20% of the ocean floor has been surveyed by ships at a spatial resolution of 400 m or better.&nbsp;The remaining 80% has depth predicted from satellite altimeter-derived gravity measurements at a relatively low resolution. There are many remote ocean areas in the southern hemisphere that will not be completely mapped at 400 m resolution during this decade. This study is focused on the development of synthetic bathymetry to fill the gaps. There are two types of seafloor features that are not typically well resolved by satellite gravity: abyssal hills and small seamounts (&lt; 2.5 km tall).&nbsp;&nbsp;We generate synthetic realizations of abyssal hills by combining the measured statistical properties of mapped abyssal hills with regional geology including fossil spreading rate/orientation, rms height from satellite gravity, and sediment thickness. With recent improvements in accuracy and resolution, It is now possible to detect all seamounts taller than about 800 m in satellite-derived gravity and their location can be determined to an accuracy of better than 1 km.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the width of the gravity anomaly is much greater than the actual width of the seamount so the seamount predicted from gravity will underestimate the true seamount height and overestimate its base dimension.

Insights can be made into these processes by studying the functional interactions (or ""motifs"") which make up these networks. Results: We sought to understand the functionality of one of these network motifs, negative feedback, in a multi-cellular system. This was accomplished using a synthetic network expressed in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo using the yeast proteins Gal4 (a transcriptional activator) and Gal80 (an inhibitor of Gal4 activity). This network is able to produce an attenuation or shuttling phenotype depending on the Gal80/Gal4 ratio. This shuttling behavior was validated by expressing Gal3, which inhibits Gal80, to produce a localized increase in free Gal4 and therefore signaling. Mathematical modeling was used to demonstrate the capacity for negative feedback to produce these varying outputs. Conclusions: The capacity of a network motif to exhibit different phenotypes due to minor changes to the network in multi-cellular systems was shown. This work demonstrates the importance of studying network motifs in multi-cellular systems."

This task has been previously done using time-consuming, mostly-manual digitizations of differential interferometric synthetic-aperture radar interferograms by human experts. This approach is no longer viable with a fast-growing set of satellite observations and the need to establish time series over entire continents with quantified uncertainties. We present a fully-convolutional neural network with parallel atrous convolutional layers and asymmetric encoder/decoder components that automatically delineates grounding lines at a large scale, efficiently, and accompanied by uncertainty estimates. Our procedure detects grounding lines within 232 m in 100-m posting interferograms, which is comparable to the performance achieved by human experts. We also find value in the machine learning approach in situations that even challenge human experts. We use this approach to map the tidal-induced variability in grounding line position around Antarctica in 22,935 interferograms from year 2018. Along the Getz Ice Shelf, in West Antarctica, we demonstrate that grounding zones are one order magnitude (13.3 ± 3.9) wider than expected from hydrostatic equilibrium, which justifies the need to map grounding lines repeatedly and comprehensively to inform numerical models.</p><p></p>"

This latter aspect leads to a reduced number of flowers fruits and seeds in Solanum lycopersicum. To know the effects of an excess of SLs on the reproductive phenotype in tomato we analyzed the results of the exogenous treatments with rac-GR24, a synthetic strigolactone and with a biostimulant SL-enriched produced by StrigoLab.

<p>Experiments have been conducted over a 5G metro/regional RINA network scenario spanning from the end-user terminal until the server where applications run in the datacentre has been defined.&nbsp;Over the last years, the clean-slate Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) (http://pouzinsociety.org)&nbsp;has attracted significant interest from the Future Internet research community, seen as a viable solution to solve the well-known limitations of the current TCP/IP-based Internet, e.g., in terms of routing scalability, application-specific Quality of Service (QoS) delivery or built-in security.</p>

<p>The ERASER project targeted experimental evaluations of the QoS guarantees that RINA can deliver to heterogeneous applications. These experiments have been conducted over the Fed4FIRE+ Virtual Wall experimentation facility hosted and operated by imec in Ghent (Belgium).&nbsp;</p>

<p>First experiments in ERASER have contemplated a 10-node small-scale RINA scenario, aiming to integrate all RINA-related open source implementations and tools needed for the entire experiments and validate their operation to meet the ERASER objectives.&nbsp;Two alternative QTA-Mux (i.e., the policy responsible for the RINA QoS support) deployment scenarios have been considered. This has been followed by a definition of the QoS classes (referred to as QoS Cubes in RINA) that QTA-Mux has to enforce, with their relative requirements in terms of losses and delay, as well as the characteristics of the synthetic application flows that will be injected in the network.</p>

<p>Second experiments consider a large-scale metro/regional RINA network scenario composed of 37 nodes, eventually, where measurements of delay and packet losses experienced by synthetic traffic flows end-to-end have been obtained&nbsp;for the two considered QTA-Mux deployment scenarios and under different load conditions (links operating at 70, 80 and 90% of their effective capacity).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The obtained results highlight the need for configuring QTA-Mux at both Service Provider Network and Metro-Regional network layers in order to provide effective QoS differentiation in terms of both delay and losses, particularly under high network congestion (link loads of 80% and 90%). Conversely, configuring QTA-Mux only at the Service Provider Network layer falls short of delivering adequate QoS differentiation, as best-effort packet treatment at the underlying Metro-Regional network layer deteriorates it, with all synthetic application flow types experiencing similar delay and packet loss outcomes end-to-end.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.0sn63,open,"Data from: The effects of dietary macronutrients on flight ability, energetics, and fuel metabolism of yellow-rumped warblers Setophaga coronata","The catabolism of protein from organs and muscles during migratory flight is necessary to produce glucose, key metabolic intermediates, and water, but may have negative effects on flight range and refueling at stopovers. We tested the hypothesis, suggested by previous studies, that birds that eat high-protein insect diets use more protein for fuel in flight than those that eat high-carbohydrate fruits. First, we fed migratory yellow-rumped warblers synthetic fruit or mixed insect/fruit diets, and measured metabolic rates and fuel mixture under basal conditions and during exercise in a hop/hover wheel respirometer. Birds eating the fruit diet had greater plasma triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations, and the higher protein mixed diet increased plasma uric acid only during feeding. Diet did not affect metabolic rates or the fuel mixture under resting or exercise conditions. We then fed yellow-rumped warblers synthetic diets that differed only in the relative proportion of carbohydrate and protein (60:15 versus 15:60 as % dry mass) and tested them in wind tunnel flights lasting up to six hours. Birds fed the high carbohydrate diet became heavier and fatter than when fed the high protein diet. Plasma uric acid concentration was increased and plasma phospholipid concentration was decreased by the high protein diet in the pre-flight state (after a 3 h fast), but diet only affected plasma phospholipids during flight (lower in high protein birds). Neither diet nor amount of body fat affected the rate of loss of lean mass or fat during flight. Inter-individual or seasonal differences in diet do not appear to influence the amount of protein catabolized during endurance flight. However, birds fed the high carbohydrate diet had greater voluntary flight duration, independent of body fatness, suggesting that there may be other performance benefits of high carbohydrate diets for migratory birds."

Stellar models,"<p>We study the initial conditions of a common envelope (CE) event resulting in a stellar merger. A merger&rsquo;s dynamics could be understood through its light curve, but no synthetic light curve has yet been created for the full evolution. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code StarSmasher, we have created three-dimensional (3D) models of a 1.52&thinsp;M<sub>⊙</sub> star that is a plausible donor in the V1309&nbsp;Sco progenitor. The integrated total energy profiles of our 3D models match their initial one-dimensional (1D) models to within a 0.1&thinsp;per&nbsp;cent difference in the top 0.1&thinsp;M<sub>⊙</sub> of their envelopes. We have introduced a new method for obtaining radiative flux by linking intrinsically optically thick SPH particles to a single stellar envelope solution from a set of unique solutions.

10.5061/dryad.s7355g5,open,Data from: No additive genetic variance for tolerance to ethynylestradiol exposure in natural populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta),"One of the most common and potent pollutants of freshwater habitats is 17-alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic component of oral contraceptives that is not completely eliminated during sewage treatment and that threatens natural populations of fish. Previous studies found additive genetic variance for the tolerance against EE2 in different salmonid fishes and concluded that rapid evolution to this type of pollution seems possible. However, these previous studies were done with fishes that are lake-dwelling and hence typically less exposed to EE2 than river-dwelling species. Here we test whether there is additive genetic variance for the tolerance against EE2 also in river-dwelling salmonid populations that have been exposed to various concentrations of EE2 over the last decades. We sampled 287 adult brown trout (Salmo trutta) from 7 populations that show much genetic diversity within populations, are genetically differentiated, and that vary in their exposure to sewage-treated effluent. In order to estimate their potential to evolve tolerance to EE2, we collected their gametes to produce 730 experimental families in block-wise full factorial in vitro fertilizations. We then raised 7,302 embryos singly in 2 mL containers each and either exposed them to 1 ng/L EE2 (an ecologically relevant concentration, i.e. 2 pg per embryo added in a single spike to the water) or sham-treated them. Exposure to EE2 increased embryo mortality, delayed hatching time, and decreased hatchling length. We found no population differences and no additive genetic variance for tolerance to EE2. We conclude that EE2 has detrimental effects that may adversely affect population even at a very low concentration, but that our study populations lack the potential for rapid genetic adaptation to this type of pollution. One possible explanation for the latter is that continuous selection over the last decades has depleted genetic variance for tolerance to this synthetic stressor."

10.5061/dryad.8206227,open,Data from: Verbalizing phylogenomic conflict: representation of node congruence across competing reconstructions of the neoavian explosion,"Phylogenomic research is accelerating the publication of landmark studies that aim to resolve deep divergences of major organismal groups. Meanwhile, systems for identifying and integrating the products of phylogenomic inference–such as newly supported clade concepts–have not kept pace. However, the ability to verbalize node concept congruence and conflict across multiple, in effect simultaneously endorsed phylogenomic hypotheses, is a prerequisite for building synthetic data environments for biological systematics and other domains impacted by these conflicting inferences. Here we develop a novel solution to the conflict verbalization challenge, based on a logic representation and reasoning approach that utilizes the language of Region Connection Calculus (RCC–5) to produce consistent alignments of node concepts endorsed by incongruent phylogenomic studies. The approach employs clade concept labels to individuate concepts used by each source, even if these carry identical names. Indirect RCC–5 modeling of intensional (property-based) node concept definitions, facilitated by the local relaxation of coverage constraints, allows parent concepts to attain congruence in spite of their differentially sampled children. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we align two recent phylogenomic reconstructions of higher-level avian groups that entail strong conflict in the ""neoavian explosion"" region. According to our representations, this conflict is constituted by 26 instances of input ""whole concept"" overlap. These instances are further resolvable in the output labeling schemes and visualizations as ""split concepts"", which provide the labels and relations needed to build truly synthetic phylogenomic data environments. Because the RCC–5 alignments fundamentally reflect the trained, logic-enabled judgments of systematic experts, future designs for such environments need to promote a culture where experts routinely assess the intensionalities of node concepts published by our peers–even and especially when we are not in agreement with each other."
10.5061/dryad.122sv,open,Data from: Bacterial quorum sensing and metabolic incentives to cooperate,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a cell-cell communication system termed ""quorum sensing"" to control production of public goods, extracellular products that can be used by any community member. Not all individuals respond to quorum-sensing signals and synthesize public goods. Such social cheaters enjoy the benefits of the products secreted by cooperators. There are some P. aeruginosa cellular enzymes controlled by quorum sensing, and we show that quorum sensing–controlled expression of such private goods can put a metabolic constraint on social cheating and prevent a tragedy of the commons.

During PG specification, TGIF2 was induced alone (VA on D0-3, No DOX), HHEX was induced alone (VA on D0-4, No DOX), or TGIF2 and HHEX were both maintained uninduced (VA on D0-4, No DOX) on day 3-4 by removal or addition of VA and DOX as specified. VA indicates addition of vanillic acid (500 &micro;M) and DOX indicates addition of doxycycline (0.75 &micro;g/mL) to the culture medium. The expression levels for HHEX and TGIF2 on day 4 during PG differentiation of iHHEX/iTGIF2 hiPSC-derived DE cells were determined by means of qRT-PCR.

10.5281/zenodo.572233,open,A modular set of synthetic spectral energy distributions for young stellar objects - Robitaille (2017) - v1.1 [Hyperion files],"<p>These are the input and output files for the radiative transfer code (Hyperion) for the model sets presented in</p>

<p><em>A modular set of synthetic spectral energy distributions for young stellar objects</em>, Robitaille (2017)</p>

<p>Each model set is provided as a single tar file. Each tar file expands to <strong>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;</strong>, so if you expand all tar files in the same folder, you will end up with a single <strong>grids-1.1</strong> folder with 18 sub-folders, one for each model set.</p>

<p>For a given model set, the files are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;/input - input Hyperion files</li>
	<li>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;/log - log files from Hyperion</li>
	<li>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;/output - output Hyperion files</li>
	<li>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;/par - parameters for each model</li>
	<li>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;/ranges.conf - ranges of parameters varied in the model set</li>
	<li>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;/parameters.hdf5 - table of parameters for all models</li>
	<li>grids-1.1/&lt;set name&gt;/d03_5.5_3.0_A_sub.hdf5 - dust file used for the models</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the large number of models for some of the model sets, the models are not all stored directly inside the par, input, output or log directories - instead these directories contain folders formed from the first two characters (forced to lowercase) of the names of the models they contain. For example, a3 contains all models whose name starts with a3 or A3. This was done to avoid having too many files in a single folder which can cause issues on certain file systems.</p>

<p>For the Hyperion input and output files, in some cases an _sed file is present. In these cases, the output SEDs (and polarization spectra) should be read from the _sed file, not the original output file. This is the case for all models that are in a set for which the ambient medium was present, as described in §4.2.3 of Robitaille (2017). Furthermore, in some cases the SED file is called _sed_noscat to indicate that scattering was not included, as described in §5.1 of Robitaille (2017).</p>

<p>To avoid taking up too much disk space, the Hyperion HDF5 input/output files use external links to refer to each other and to the dust file. To make sure the links work, you should do all operations with the input/output files from the directory containing <strong>grids-1.1</strong>. For example, to open a Hyperion output file, you would need to do (in Python):</p>

<p>    In [1]: from hyperion.model import ModelOutput</p>

<p>    In [2]: mo = ModelOutput('grids-1.1/s---s-i/output/a3/A3kQmQtj.rtout')</p>

<p>A notebook with examples of reading in the output files can be found here:</p>

<p>https://github.com/hyperion-rt/paper-2017-sed-models/blob/master/notebook_raw/reading_raw_files.ipynb</p>

10.5281/zenodo.5414555,open,Synthetic dataset of a full wavefield representing the propagation of Lamb waves and their interactions with delaminations,"<p>The dataset contains 475 simulated cases of full wavefield of Lamb waves propagation in a plate made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). The simulated 475 cases represent delaminations with different locations, shapes, and&nbsp;sizes. The following random factors were simulated in each case:</p>

<ul>
	<li>delamination geometrical size (ellipse minor and major axis randomly selected from the interval [10 mm, 40 mm],</li>
	<li>delamination angle (randomly selected from the interval [0◦ , 180◦]),</li>
	<li>coordinates of the centre of delamination (randomly selected from the interval [0 mm, 250 mm &minus; &delta;] and [250 mm + &delta;, 500 mm], where &delta; = 10&nbsp;mm).</li>
</ul>

<p>The guided waves were excited at the centre of the plate by applying equivalent piezoelectric forces. The excitation was in the form of toneburst sine signal modulated by the Hann window. The carrier frequency is assumed 50 kHz, and the&nbsp;modulation frequency is 10 kHz.&nbsp;The total wave propagation time was set to 0.75 ms&nbsp;so that the guided wave can propagate to plate edges and back to the actuator&nbsp;twice. The number of time integration steps was 150000 which was selected for the stability of the central difference scheme.</p>

<p>The material is a typical cross-ply CFRP laminate. The stacking sequence&nbsp;[0/90]<sub>4</sub> was used in the model. The properties of a single-ply were as follows&nbsp;[GPa]: C<sub>11</sub> = 52.55, C<sub>12</sub> = 6.51, C<sub>22</sub> = 51.83, C<sub>44</sub> = 2.93, C<sub>55</sub> = 2.92, C<sub>66</sub> =&nbsp;3.81. The assumed mass density was 1522.4 kg/m3. These properties were&nbsp;selected so that simulated numerically wave front patterns and wavelengths are&nbsp;similar to the wavefields measured by SLDV on CFRP specimens used later on&nbsp;for testing the developed methods for delamination&nbsp;identification. The shortest&nbsp;wavelength of propagating A0 Lamb wave mode was 21.2 mm for numerical&nbsp;simulations and 19.5 mm for experimental measurements.</p>

<p><br>
In each delamination case, 512 frames were generated to visualise the propagation of Lamb waves and their interactions and reflections from the delamination&nbsp;and edges.<br>
The numerically generated dataset resembles the velocity measurements acquired by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV) at the bottom surface of&nbsp;the plate of dimensions&nbsp;500&times;500 mm.</p>

<p>The uploaded dataset contains two ZIP files:</p>

<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;The first file contains 475 folders regarding all&nbsp;cases of different delaminations and their interaction with Lamb waves. In each case, there are 512 images in PNG format representing the propagation of guided waves.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The second file contains:
	<ul>
		<li>475 images in PNG format representing the ground truth of the delaminations.</li>
		<li>CSV file contains all info regarding delaminations.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microbiome research is hampered by the fact that many bacteria are still unknown and by the lack of publicly available isolates. Fundamental and clinical research is in need of comprehensive and well-curated repositories of cultured bacteria from the intestine of mammalian hosts. Due to host-specific features of the gut microbiota, it is sound to establish collections of isolates from single host species. Hence, this project established a collection of bacterial strains isolated from the intestine of mice.</p>

<p>The original version of the collection published in 2016 (Lagkouvardos, et. al. 2016.<em> Nat. Microbiol.</em>).&nbsp;was doubled by the addition of 112 strains, representing a total of 141 species across 6 phyla and 35 families for the entire collection. As we aimed to create a well-curated resource, all bacterial species within miBC have been taxonomically described and are publicly available.</p>

10.5061/dryad.n8pk0p2sd,open,Data from: Footprint of the host restriction factors APOBEC3 on the genome of human viruses,"<p><span><span>APOBEC3 enzymes are innate immune effectors that introduce mutations into viral genomes. These enzymes are cytidine deaminases which transform cytosine into uracil. They preferentially mutate cytidine preceded by thymidine making the 5'TC motif their favored target. Viruses have evolved different strategies to evade APOBEC3 restriction. Certain viruses actively encode viral proteins antagonizing the APOBEC3s, others passively face the APOBEC3 selection pressure thanks to a depleted genome for APOBEC3-targeted motifs. Hence, the APOBEC3s left on the genome of certain viruses an evolutionary footprint.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The aim of our study is the identification of these viruses having a genome shaped by the APOBEC3s. We analyzed the genome of 33,400 human viruses for the depletion of APOBEC3-favored motifs. We demonstrate that the APOBEC3 selection pressure impacts at least 22% of all currently annotated human viral species. The <i>papillomaviridae</i> and <i>polyomaviridae</i> are the most intensively footprinted families; evidencing a selection pressure acting genome-wide and on both strands. Members of the <i>parvoviridae</i> family are differentially targeted in term of both magnitude and localization of the footprint. Interestingly, a massive APOBEC3 footprint is present on both strands of the B19 erythroparvovirus; making this viral genome one of the most cleaned sequences for APOBEC3-favored motifs. We also identified the endemic <i>coronaviridae</i> as significantly footprinted. Interestingly, no such footprint has been detected on the zoonotic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. In addition to viruses that are footprinted genome-wide, certain viruses are footprinted only on very short sections of their genome. That is the case for the <i>gamma-herpesviridae</i> and <i>adenoviridae</i> where the footprint is localized on the lytic origins of replication. A mild footprint can also be detected on the negative strand of the reverse transcribing HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1 and HBV viruses.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Together, our data illustrate the extent of the APOBEC3 selection pressure on the human viruses and identify new putatively APOBEC3-targeted viruses.</span></span></p>"

The disks are modified with a synthetic sialylglycopolymer receptor layer,and the coated disks are inserted in a flowing virus suspension. Label-free detection of the virus is achieved by monitoring the disk radial mode resonance frequency shift. Piezo transducers with sialylglycopolymer sensor layers exhibited a long lifetime, a high sensitivity, and the possibility of regeneration. We demonstrate positive, label-free detection of Influenza A viruses at concentrations below 10^5 virus particles per millilitre. We show that label-free, selective, sensitive detection of Influenza viruses by home appliances is possible in principle."

We surveyed paired invaded and uninvaded plant communities from three biomes. We reconcile the discrepancy in diversity loss from invaders by showing that invaded communities have lower local richness but steeper species accumulation with area than that of uninvaded communities, leading to proportionately fewer species loss at broader spatial scales. We show that invaders drive scale-dependent biodiversity loss through strong neutral sampling effects on the number of individuals in a community. We also show that nonneutral species extirpations are due to a proportionately larger effect of invaders on common species, suggesting that rare species are buffered against extinction. Our study provides a synthetic perspective on the threat of invasions to biodiversity loss across spatial scales."

However, proteins rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of trends in protein sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on protein surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered proteins for protein solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments. The heteropolymers, with optimized composition and statistical monomer distribution, enable cell-free synthesis of membrane proteins with proper protein folding for transport and enzyme-containing plastics for toxin bioremediation. Controlling the statistical monomer distribution in a heteropolymer, rather than the specific monomer sequence, affords a new strategy to interface with biological systems for protein-based biomaterials."

<p>Description<br>
--------------</p>

<p>The BirdVox-scaper-10k dataset contains 9983 artificial soundscapes. Each soundscape lasts exactly ten seconds and contains one or several avian flight calls from up to 30 different species of New World warblers (Parulidae). Alongside each audio file, we include an annotation file describing the start time and end time of each flight call in the corresponding soundscape, as well as the species of warbler it belongs to.</p>

<p>In order to synthesize soundscapes in BirdVox-scaper-10k, we mixed natural sounds from various pre-recorded sources. First, we extracted isolated recordings of flight calls containing little or no background noise from the CLO-43SD dataset [1]. Secondly, we extracted 10-second &quot;empty&quot; acoustic scenes from the BirdVox-DCASE-20k dataset [2]. These acoustic scenes contain various sources of real-world background noise, including biophony (insects) and anthropophony (vehicles), yet are guaranteed to be devoid of any flight calls. Lastly, we &quot;fill&quot; each acoustic scene by mixing it with flight calls sampled at random.</p>

<p>Although the BirdVox-scaper-10k does not consist of natural recordings, we have taken several measures to ensure the plausibility of each synthesized soundscape, both from qualitative and quantitative standpoints.<br>
<br>
The BirdVox-scaper-10k dataset can be used, among other things, for the research, development, and testing of bioacoustic classification models.</p>

However, current syynthetic replicas rarelyy capture the range of structural complexityy observed in natural materials. Prior to the definition of a biomimetic design, a dual investigation with a common set of criteria for comparing the biological material and the replica is required. Here, we deal with this issue by addressing the non-trivial case of insect cuticles tessellated with polygonal microcells with iridescent colors due to the twisted cholesteric organization of chitin fibers. By using hyperspectral imaging within a common methodology, we compare, at several length scales, the textural, structural and spectral properties of the microcells found in the two-band cuticle of the scarab beetle <i>Chrysina gloriosa</i> with those of the polygonal texture formed in flat films of cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. The hyperspectral imaging technique offers a unique opportunity to reveal the common features and differences in the spectral-spatial signatures of biological and synthetic samples at a 6-nm spectral resolution over 400 nm-1000 nm and a spatial resolution of 150 nm. The biomimetic design of chiral tessellations is relevant to the field of non-specular properties such as deflection and lensing in geometric phase planar optics.</p>"

10.5281/zenodo.3941890,open,Synthetic river datasets built for testing and development of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission discharge algorithms,"<p><strong>1.Summary</strong></p>

<p>Datasets used for testing the performance of discharge estimation algorithms built in support of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission. The benchmarking manuscript entitled &ldquo;Exploring the factors controlling the performance of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission discharge algorithms&rdquo; is currently under review at Water Resources Research. Once the manuscript is accepted, its DOI will be included here.</p>

<p><strong>2.File description</strong></p>

<p>The dataset is divided into four groups: 1-Ideal data, 2-Varying Temporal Sampling, 3-Measurement Uncertainty, and 4-SWOT Sampling and Uncertainty. Ideal data contains daily measurements with no observational uncertainty. Varying Temporal Sampling downsamples the ideal measurements considering different temporal frequencies with complete sets assuming: 1 measurement every 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, and 21 days. The measurement uncertainty set adds errors to cross-sectional heights and widths, which are used to compute reach average height, width, and slope considering error corruption. The final set SWOT Sampling and Uncertainty accounts for SWOT temporal sampling and measurement uncertainty. Sets containing uncertainty have extra height, width, and slope attributes with the word true appended to the attribute name. Such attributes represent the uncorrupted measurements at the cross-section and reach scales. Height, width, and slopes for the SWOT sampling and Uncertainty dataset containing the value of negative 9999 denote points that are not observed at a particular location and time step.</p>

<p>This data set relates to our paper <em>“Synthetic inversions for density using seismic and gravity data”</em><em>, </em><em>in which we discuss the imaging of density variations inside the Earth as a separate, independent parameter using seismic waveform tomography and gravity measurements</em>. The research consists of synthetic experiments conducted using a home-written MATLAB wave propagation code. The data set contains the code itself, the input files and output files for each of the experiments described in the manuscript and its supplementary material, all the figures, some extra material (such as a video of Figure 1 in the manuscript) and some scripts.</p>

<p>Below I’ll give a description of the contents of this data set and how they are structured, followed by an overview of the experiments conducted for the paper.</p>

<p>In this data set, the following things can be found:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>There is a directory with all the figures: FIGURES. This contains the figures in *.pdf, *.eps and *.png formats.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There is a directory FD2D_ADJOINT_CODE with in it the MATLAB code fd2d-adjoint. If you plan on using our code, it would be awfully kind if you'd make a reference both to the code and to this paper. It was a lot of work to develop the code and the experiments. NOTE: the code supplied here is a snapshot of the code taken in February 2017. A more up-to-date version might be found on github (www.github.com/Phlos/fd2d-adjoint)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For each (series of) experiment(s) described in the paper, there is a directory T1, T2, …, Tn. This also holds for the supplementary tests, the folders for which are designated with the suffix .SUPPLEMENTARY.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For Figure 1 in the manuscript, there is a directory Fig1.snapshots. In this directory, everything pertaining to the snapshots figure and its corresponding video can be found.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There is a separate directory SCRIPTS with a couple of useful scripts that might be used in addition to the ones in the fd2d-adjoint code.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
In each of the test directories T1...Tn, there are subdirectories for each experiment conducted within that test framework. Each of the subdirectories has a name Systematic.test-[xxx]. Within those Systematic.. directories, the following can be found:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>an input file Systematic….input_parameters.m that can be copied to [fd2d-adjoint]/input/input_parameters.m in order to re-run the experiment. As the code has been under development while the tests were run, it may be that some input parameters are missing from the earlier experiments.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A mat-file obs.all-vars.mat. If this file is copied to [fd2d-adjoint]/output/Systematic.test… , this saves the recalculation of the ‘obs’ data when the code is run.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A mat-file initial_misfits.mat. If this file is copied to [fd2d-adjoint]/output/Systematic.test… , this saves the recomputation of the initial misfits with respect to the obs data when the code is run.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A file lbfgs_output_log.txt which monitors the misfit and gradient development across the iterations. If the inversion was restarted a couple of times, all of this remains in the logfile.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For each iteration of the inversion iter[xxx], an iter[xxx].all-vars.mat file, which contains most of the matlab output files for this iteration.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For each iteration of the inversion iter[xxx], some figures:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>a model plot of the current model anomalies with respect to the background model iter[xxx].model-diff.rhovsvp.png.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>a gravity plot of the gravity vector difference between the current model and the background model iter[xxx].gravity_difference.png.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>a kernel plot of the total relative kernels (whether seis only or seis+grav) of the current model in rho-mu-lambda parametrisation: iter[xxx].rho-mu-lambda.png.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

10.5281/zenodo.4981140,open,Synthetic realistic noise-corrupted PPG database and noise generator for the evaluation of PPG denoising and delineation algorithms,"<p><strong>Overview </strong></p>

<p>This database is meant to evaluate the performance of denoising and delineation algorithms for PPG signals affected by noise. The noise generator allows applying the algorithms under test to an artificially corrupted reference PPG signal and comparing its output to the output obtained with the original signal. Moreover, the noise generator can produce artifacts of variable intensities, permitting the evaluation of the algorithms&#39; performance against different noise levels. The reference signal is a PPG sample of a healthy subject at rest during a relaxing session.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Database</strong></p>

<p>The database includes 1 recording of 72 seconds of synchronous PPG and ECG signals sampled at 250 Hz using a Medicom device, ABP-10 module (Medicom MTD Ltd., Russia). It was collected from a healthy subject during an induced relaxation by guided autogenic relaxation. For more information about the data collection, please refer to the following publication:&nbsp;<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30094756/"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30094756/</a></p>

<p>In addition, PPG signals corrupted by the noise generator at different levels are also included in the database.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Realistic noise generator</strong></p>

<p>Motion Artifacts in PPG signals generally appear in the form of sudden spikes (in correspondence to the subject&#39;s movement) and slowly varying offsets (baseline wander) due to the changes in distance between the skin and the sensor after every sudden movement. For this reason, conventional noise generators &mdash; using random noise drawn from different distributions such as Gaussian or Poissonian &mdash; do not allow to properly evaluate the algorithm&#39;s performance, as they can only provide unrealistic noises compared to the one commonly found in PPG signals. To overcome this issue, we designed a more realistic synthetic noise generator that can simulate those two behaviors, enabling us to corrupt a reference signal with different noise levels. The details about noise generation are available in the reference paper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Data Files</strong></p>

<p>The reference PPG signal can be found in <em>Datasets\GoodSignals\PPG</em> and the simultaneously acquired ECG in <em>Datasets\GoodSignals\ECG</em>. The folder <em>Datasets\NoisySignals</em> contains 340 noisy PPG signals affected by different levels of noise. The names describe the intensity of the noise (evaluated in terms of the standard deviation of the random noise used as input for the noise generator, see reference paper). Five noisy signals are produced for every noise level by running the noise generator with five random seeds each (for noise generation).</p>

<p>Name convention: <em>ppg_stdx_y</em> denotes the y-th noisy PPG signal produced using a noise with a standard deviation of x.</p>

<p><em>Datasets\BPMs</em> contains the ground truth for the heart-rate estimation computed in windows of 8s with an overlap of 2s.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<p>The folder <em>Code </em>contains the MATLAB scripts to generate the noisy files by generating the realistic noise with the function noiseGenerator.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.5801914,open,Data for Cyrillic Reference Parsing,"<p>We provide a <strong>synthetic reference data set</strong> covering over 100,000 labeled references (mostly Russian language) and a manually annotated set of real references (771 in number) gathered from multidisciplinary <strong>Cyrillic script publications</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>Extracting structured data from bibliographic references is a crucial task for the creation of scholarly databases. While approaches, tools, and evaluation data sets for the task exist, there is a distinct lack of support for languages other than English and scripts other than the Latin alphabet. A significant portion of the scientific literature that is thereby excluded consists of publications written in Cyrillic script languages. To address this problem, we introduce a new multilingual and multidisciplinary data set of over 100,000 labeled reference strings. The data set covers multiple Cyrillic languages and contains over 700 manually labeled references, while the remaining are generated synthetically. With random samples of varying size of this data, we train multiple well-performing sequence labeling BERT models and thus show the usability of our proposed data set. To this end, we showcase an implementation of a multilingual BERT model trained on the synthetic data and evaluated on the manually labeled references. Our model achieves an F1 score of 0.93 and thereby significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art model we retrain and evaluate on our data.</p>

<p>The code for generating the data set is available at <a href=""https://github.com/igor261/Sequence-Labeling-for-Citation-Field-Extraction-from-Cyrillic-Script-References"">https://github.com/igor261/Sequence-Labeling-for-Citation-Field-Extraction-from-Cyrillic-Script-References</a></p>

The ATR-CHK1 pathway is an essential component of this response, which regulates cell cycle progression in the face of replication stress. PARP14 is an ADP-ribosyltransferase with multiple roles in transcription, signaling, and DNA repair. To understand the biological functions of PARP14, we catalogued the genetic components that impact cellular viability upon loss of PARP14 by performing an unbiased, comprehensive, genome-wide CRISPR knockout genetic screen in PARP14-deficient cells. We uncovered the ATR-CHK1 pathway as essential for viability of PARP14-deficient cells, and identified regulation of DNA replication dynamics as an important mechanistic contributor to the synthetic lethality observed. Our work shows that PARP14 is an important modulator of the response to ATR-CHK1 pathway inhibitors.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.cs6t6,open,Data from: Implementation of complex biological logic circuits using spatially distributed multicellular consortia,"Engineered synthetic biological devices have been designed to perform a variety of functions from sensing molecules and bioremediation to energy production and biomedicine. Notwithstanding, a major limitation of in vivo circuit implementation is the constraint associated to the use of standard methodologies for circuit design. Thus, future success of these devices depends on obtaining circuits with scalable complexity and reusable parts. Here we show how to build complex computational devices using multicellular consortia and space as key computational elements. This spatial modular design grants scalability since its general architecture is independent of the circuit's complexity, minimizes wiring requirements and allows component reusability with minimal genetic engineering. The potential use of this approach is demonstrated by implementation of complex logical functions with up to six inputs, thus demonstrating the scalability and flexibility of this method. The potential implications of our results are outlined."

10.5061/dryad.mw6m905z2,open,Geographic variation in the matching between call characteristics and tympanic sensitivity in the Weeping lizard,"<p>Effective communication requires a match among signal characteristics, environmental conditions, and receptor tuning and decoding. The degree of matching, however, can vary, among others due to different selective pressures affecting the communication components. For evolutionary novelties, strong selective pressures are likely to act upon the signal and receptor to promote a tight match among them. We test this prediction by exploring the coupling between the acoustic signals and auditory sensitivity in <em>Liolaemus chiliensis,</em> the Weeping lizard, the only one of more than 285 <em>Liolaemus</em> species that vocalizes. Individuals emit distress calls that convey information of predation risk to conspecifics, which may respond with antipredator behaviors upon hearing calls. Specifically, we explored the match between spectral characteristics of the distress calls and the tympanic sensitivities of two populations separated by more than 700 km, for which previous data suggested variation in their distress calls. We found that populations differed in signal and receptor characteristics and that this signal variation was explained by population differences in body size. No precise match occurred between the communication components studied, and populations differed in the degree of such correspondence. We suggest that this difference in matching between populations relates to evolutionary processes affecting the Weeping lizard distress calls.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.hmgqnk9f6,open,Resistance-recovery tradeoff of soil microbial communities under altered rain regimes: An experimental test across European agroecosystems,"<ol>
	<li>With the increased occurrence of climate extremes, there is an urgent need to better understand how management strategies affect the capacity of the soil microbial community to maintain its ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient cycling).</li>
	<li>To address this issue, intact monoliths were extracted from conventional and ecological managed grasslands in three countries across Europe and exposed under common air condition (temperature and moisture) to one of three altered rain regimes (dry, wet and intermittent wet/dry) as compared to a normal regime. Subsequently, we compared the resistance and recovery of the soil microbial biomass, potential enzyme activities and community composition.</li>
	<li>The microbial community composition differed with soil management and rain regimes. Soil microbial biomass increased from the wetter to the dryer rain regime, paralleling an increase of available carbon and nutrients, suggesting low sensitivity to soil moisture reduction but nutritional limitations of soil microbes. Conversely, enzyme activities decreased with all altered rain regimes.</li>
	<li>Resistance and recovery (considering absolute distance between normal and altered rain regime) of the microbial communities depended on soil management. Conventional-intensive management showed higher resistance of two fundamental properties for nutrient cycling (i.e. bacterial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities) yet associated with more important changes in microbial community composition. This suggests an internal community reorganization promoting biomass and activity resistance. Conversely, under ecological management bacterial biomass and enzyme activities showed better recovery capacity, whereas no or very low recovery of these properties was observed under conventional management. These management effects were consistent across the three altered rain regimes investigated, indicating common factors controlling microbial communities' response to different climate-related stresses.</li>
	<li>Synthesis and applications: Our study provides experimental evidence for an important trade-off for agro-ecosystem management between i.) stabilizing nutrient cycling potential during an altered rain regime period at the expense of very low recovery capacity and potential long term effect (conventional sites) and ii.) promoting the capacity of the microbial community to recover its functional potential after the end of the stress (ecological sites). Thus management based on ecologically sound principles may be the best option to sustain long-term soil functioning under climate change.</li>

10.5061/dryad.47c8q50,open,Data from: Influence of synthetic abscisic acid (ABA) seed coating on seed germination rate and timing of Bluebunch wheatgrass,"Semi-arid rangeland degradation is a reoccurring issue throughout the world. In the Great Basin of North America, seeds sown in the fall to restore degraded sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe plant communities may experience high mortality in winter due to exposure of seedlings to freezing temperatures and other stressors. Delaying germination until early spring when conditions are more suitable for growth may increase survival. We evaluated the use of BioNikTM (Valent BioSciences LLC) synthetic abscisic acid (S-ABA) to delay germination of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata). Seed was either left untreated or coated at five separate rates of S-ABA ranging from 0.25 - 6.0 g 100 g-1 of seed. Seeds were incubated at five separate constant temperatures from 5-25 °C. From the resultant germination data, we developed quadratic thermal accumulation models for each treatment and applied them to four-years of historic soil moisture and temperature data across six sagebrush steppe sites to predict germination timing. Total germination percentage remained similar across all temperatures except at 25 °C, where high S-ABA rates had slightly lower values. All S-ABA concentrations delayed germination, with the greatest delays at 5-10 °C. For example, the time required for 50% of the seeds to germinate at 5 °C was increased by 16 - 46 d, depending on the amount of S-ABA applied. Seed germination models predicted that the majority of untreated seed would germinate 5-11 weeks after a 15 October simulated planting date. In contrast, seeds treated with S-ABA were predicted to delay germination to late winter or early spring. These results indicate that S-ABA coatings may delay germination of fall planted seed until conditions are more suitable for plant survival and growth."

10.5061/dryad.6n5h0pb,open,Data from: Flowers respond to pollinator sound within minutes by increasing nectar sugar concentration.,"Can plants sense natural airborne sounds and respond to them rapidly? We show that Oenothera drummondii flowers, exposed to playback sound of a flying bee or to synthetic sound-signals at similar frequencies, produce sweeter nectar within 3 minutes, potentially increasing the chances of cross pollination. We found that the flowers vibrated mechanically in response to these sounds, suggesting a plausible mechanism where the flower serves as an auditory sensory organ. Both the vibration and the nectar response were frequency-specific: the flowers responded and vibrated to pollinator sounds, but not to higher frequency sound. Our results document for the first time that plants can rapidly respond to pollinator sounds in an ecologically relevant way. Potential implications include plant resource allocation, the evolution of flower shape, and the evolution of pollinators sound. Finally, our results suggest that plants may be affected by other sounds as well, including antropogenic ones."

We performed screens of a fragment library and identified small molecules bound to pockets in the two domains of STAG1. We also developed assays for binding of RAD21 peptides to STAG1, which can be used to screen for molecules that disrupt binding.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.vmcvdncp4,open,The cost and benefit of quorum sensing controlled bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus plantarum,"Bacteria eliminate competitors via 'chemical warfare' with bacteriocins. Some species appear to adjust bacteriocin production conditionally in response to the social environment. We tested whether variation in the cost and benefit of producing bacteriocins could explain such conditional behaviour, in the bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum. We found that: (1) bacterial bacteriocin production could be upregulated by either the addition of a synthetic autoinducer peptide (PLNC8IF; signalling molecule), or by a plasmid which constitutively encodes for the production of this peptide; (2) bacteriocin production is costly, leading to reduced growth when grown in poor and, to a lesser extent, in rich media; (3) bacteriocin production provides a fitness advantage, when grown in competition with sensitive strains; (4) the fitness benefits provided by bacteriocin production is greater at higher cell densities. These results show how the costs and benefits of upregulating bacteriocin production can depend upon abiotic and biotic conditions."

10.5061/dryad.7jm87bt,open,Data from: Measured perceptual nonlinearities show how ON-OFF asymmetric processing improves motion estimation in natural scenes,"Animals detect motion using a variety of visual cues that reflect regularities in the natural world. Experiments in animals across phyla have shown that motion percepts incorporate both pairwise and triplet spatiotemporal correlations that could theoretically benefit motion computation. However, it remains unclear how visual systems assemble these cues to build accurate motion estimates. Here we use comprehensive measurements of fruit fly motion perception to show how flies combine local pairwise and triplet correlations to reduce variability in motion estimates across natural scenes. By generating synthetic images with statistics controlled by maximum entropy distributions, we showed that the observed improvement occurs only when light-dark asymmetries mimic natural ones. Thus, fly behavior suggests that asymmetric ON-OFF processing is tuned to the particular statistics of natural scenes. Since all animals encounter the world's light-dark asymmetries, many visual systems are likely to use asymmetric ON-OFF processing to improve motion estimation."
10.5061/dryad.4gt21,open,Data from: Spatial patterns and predictors of trophic control in marine ecosystems,"A key question in ecology is under which conditions ecosystem structure tends to be controlled by resource availability vs. consumer pressure. Several hypotheses derived from theory, experiments and observational field studies have been advanced, yet a unified explanation remains elusive. Here, we identify common predictors of trophic control in a synthetic analysis of 52 observational field studies conducted within marine ecosystems across the Northern Hemisphere and published between 1951 and 2014. Spatial regression analysis of 45 candidate variables revealed temperature to be the dominant predictor, with unimodal effects on trophic control operating both directly (r2 = 0.32; P &lt; 0.0001) and indirectly through influences on turnover rate and quality of primary production, biodiversity and omnivory. These findings indicate that temperature is an overarching determinant of the trophic dynamics of marine ecosystems, and that variation in ocean temperature will affect the trophic structure of marine ecosystems through both direct and indirect mechanisms."

These modular proteins consist of a transmembrane pore and cytoplasmic leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Despite their known molecular architecture, the mechanism of activation and the role of the LRR domains in this process has remained elusive. Here we have addressed this question by generating synthetic nanobodies, termed sybodies, which target the LRR domain of the obligatory subunit LRRC8A.We used these binders to investigate their interaction with homomeric LRRC8A channels by cryo-electron microscopy and the consequent effect on channel activation by electrophysiology. The five identified sybodies either inhibit or enhance activity by binding to distinct epitopes of the LRR domain, thereby altering channel conformations. In combination, our work provides a set of specific modulators of LRRC8 proteins and reveals the role of their cytoplasmic domains as regulators of channel activity by allosteric mechanisms.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.mp238,open,Data from: Elevational differences in developmental plasticity determine phenological responses of grasshoppers to recent climate warming,"Annual species may increase reproduction by increasing adult body size through extended development, but risk being unable to complete development in seasonally limited environments. Synthetic reviews indicate that most, but not all, species have responded to recent climate warming by advancing the seasonal timing of adult emergence or reproduction. Here, we show that 50 years of climate change have delayed development in high-elevation, season-limited grasshopper populations, but advanced development in populations at lower elevations. Developmental delays are most pronounced for early-season species, which might benefit most from delaying development when released from seasonal time constraints. Rearing experiments confirm that population, elevation and temperature interact to determine development time. Population differences in developmental plasticity may account for variability in phenological shifts among adults. An integrated consideration of the full life cycle that considers local adaptation and plasticity may be essential for understanding and predicting responses to climate change."

However, ecological theory has been largely unsuccessful at capturing multiple macroecological abundance patterns simultaneously. Here, we propose a parsimonious model that unifies widespread ecological relationships involving local aggregation, species-abundance distributions, and species associations, and we test this model against the metacommunity structure of reef-building corals and coral reef fishes across the western and central Pacific. For both corals and fishes, the unified model simultaneously captures extremely well local species-abundance distributions, interspecific variation in the strength of spatial aggregation, patterns of community similarity, species accumulation, and regional species richness, performing far better than alternative models also examined here and in previous work on coral reefs. Our approach contributes to the development of synthetic theory for large-scale patterns of community structure in nature, and to addressing ongoing challenges in biodiversity conservation at macroecological scales."

We hereby compare several implementations of photogrammetric  algorithms (CMVS/PMVS,  CMPMVS, MVE, OpenMVS, SURE, and Agisoft PhotoScan) with respect to their performance in vegetation assessment. The evaluation is based on (a) a virtual scene where the precise location and dimensionality of objects is known a priori and is thus conducive to a quantitative comparison, and (b) using series of in-situ acquired photographs of vegetation with overlapping field of view where the photogrammetric outcomes are compared quantitatively. Performance is quantified by computing ROC curves that summarize the type-I and type-II errors between the reference and reconstructed tree models. Similar artifacts are observed in synthetic- and in-situ- based reconstructions."
10.5061/dryad.vdncjsxrr,open,Best-practice forestry management delivers diminishing returns for coral reefs with increased land-clearing,"<p>Protection of coastal ecosystems from deforestation may be the best way to protect coral reefs from sediment runoff. However, given the importance of generating economic activities for coastal livelihoods, the prohibition of development is often not feasible. In light of this, logging codes-of-practice have been developed to mitigate the impacts of logging on downstream ecosystems. However, no studies have assessed whether managed land-clearing can occur in tandem with coral reef conservation goals.</p>

<p>This study quantifies the impacts of current land use and the risk of potential logging activities on downstream coral reef condition and fisheries using a novel suite of linked land-sea models, using Kolombangara Island in the Solomon Islands as a case study. Further, we examine the ability of erosion reduction strategies stipulated in logging codes-of-practice to reduce these impacts as clearing extent increases.</p>

<p>We found that with present-day land use, reductions in live and branching coral cover and increases in turf algae were associated with exposure to sediment runoff from catchments and log ponds. Critically, reductions in fish grazer abundance and biomass were associated with increasing sediment runoff, a functional group that accounts for ~25% of subsistence fishing. At low clearing extents, although best management practices minimises the exposure of coral reefs to increased runoff, it would still result in 32% of the reef experiencing an increase in sediment exposure. If clearing extent increased, best management practices would have no impact, with a staggering 89% of coral reef area at risk compared to logging with no management.</p>

<p>Synthesis and applications: Assessing trade-offs between coastal development and protection of marine resources is a challenge for decision makers globally. Although development activities requiring clearing can be important for livelihoods, our results demonstrate that new logging in intact forest risks downstream resources important for both food and livelihood security. Importantly, our approach allows for spatially-explicit recommendations for where terrestrial management might best complement marine management. Finally, given the critical degradation feedback loops that increased sediment runoff can reinforce on coral reefs, minimising sediment runoff could play an important role in helping coral reefs recover from climate-related disturbances.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.jwstqjq5r,open,Extinction-immigration dynamics lag behind environmental filtering in shaping the composition of tropical dry forests within a changing landscape,"The impact of rapid habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity is a major issue. However, we still lack an integrative understanding of how these changes influence biodiversity dynamics over time. In this study, we investigate the effects of these changes in terms of both niche-based and neutral dynamics. We hypothesize that habitat loss has delayed effects on neutral immigration-extinction dynamics, while edge effects and environmental heterogeneity in habitat patches have rapid effects on niche-based dynamics.
We analyzed taxonomic and functional composition of 100 tree communities in a tropical dry forest landscape of New-Caledonia subject to habitat loss and fragmentation. We designed an original, process-based simulation framework, and performed Approximate Bayesian Computation to infer the influence of niche-based and neutral processes. Then, we performed partial regressions to evaluate the relationships between inferred parameter values of communities and landscape metrics (distance to edge, patch area, and habitat amount around communities), derived from either recent or past (65 yrs ago) aerial photographs, while controlling for the effect of soil and topography.
We found that landscape structure influences both environmental filtering and immigration. Immigration rate was positively related to past habitat amount surrounding communities. In contrast, environmental filtering was mostly affected by present landscape structure and mainly influenced by edge vicinity and topography.
Our results highlight that landscape changes have contrasting spatio-temporal influences on niche-based and neutral assembly dynamics. First, landscape-level habitat loss and community isolation reduce immigration and increase demographic stochasticity, resulting in slow decline of local species diversity and extinction debt. Second, recent edge creation affects environmental filtering, incurring rapid changes in community composition by favoring species with edge-adapted strategies. Our study brings new insights about temporal impacts of landscape changes on biodiversity dynamics. We stress that landscape history critically influences these dynamics and should be taken into account in conservation policies."
10.5061/dryad.d4vr0,open,"Data from: Subgenome dominance in an interspecific hybrid, synthetic allopolyploid, and a 140-year-old naturally established neo-allopolyploid monkeyflower","Recent studies have shown that one of the parental subgenomes in ancient polyploids is generally more dominant - having both retained more genes and being more highly expressed - a phenomenon termed subgenome dominance. The genomic features that determine how quickly and which subgenome dominates within a newly formed polyploid remain poorly understood. To investigate the rate of subgenome dominance emergence, we examined gene expression, gene methylation, and transposable element (TE) methylation in a natural, less than 140 year old allopolyploid (Mimulus peregrinus), a resynthesized inter-species triploid hybrid (M. robertsii), a resynthesized allopolyploid (M. peregrinus), and diploid progenitors (M. guttatus and M. luteus). We show that subgenome expression dominance occurs instantly following the hybridization of two divergent genomes and significantly increases over generations. Additionally, CHH methylation levels are significantly reduced in regions near genes and within TEs in the first generation hybrid, intermediate in the resynthesized allopolyploid, and are repatterned differently between the dominant and recessive subgenomes in the natural allopolyploid. In addition, subgenome differences in levels of TE methylation mirror the increase in expression bias observed over the generations following hybridization. These findings provide important insights into genomic and epigenomic shock that occurs following hybridization and polyploid events."

Systematic mono- and pair-wise fermentation experiments confirmed competition for fructose and cross-feeding of formate. We quantified with a mechanistic model how well tri-culture dynamics was predicted from mono-culture data. With the model as reference, we demonstrated that strains grown in co-culture behaved differently than in mono-culture and confirmed their altered behavior at the transcriptional level. In addition, we showed with replicate tri-cultures and simulations that dominance in tri-culture sensitively depended on initial conditions. Our work has important implications for gut microbial community modeling as well as ecological interaction detection from batch cultures."
10.5061/dryad.dt1h407,open,Data from: Varying the spatial arrangement of synthetic herbivore-induced plant volatiles and companion plants to improve conservation biological control,"1.Conservation biological control aims to control pests by promoting wild populations of natural enemies.  One challenge is to attract and retain efficient natural enemies in crop fields, which often are a suboptimal environment.  Towards this goal, the attract-and-reward strategy relies on combining attractive synthetically produced herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) with companion plants (non-crop plants which provide alternative resources to the targeted natural enemies).  Although severely overlooked, the spatial arrangement of HIPV dispensers and rewards inside crop fields may strongly influence the foraging behaviour and persistence of natural enemies and thus the success of this pest management strategy.
2.We tested the impact of two contrasting spatial arrangements of  HIPV dispensers and rewards, alternatively inside and around a block of target apple trees, on the efficacy of the biological control of Aphis citricola populations by the common predatory ladybird Propylea japonica in apple orchards in northern China.  We used synthetic methyl salicylate (MeSA) as an attractant and the companion plant Calendula officinalis as a reward.  To better understand how the spatial arrangement of MeSA dispensers and companion plants affected the attraction and foraging behaviour of adult ladybirds, we conducted indoor experiments in a flight mill, an olfactometer and a wind-tunnel.
3.Blocks of target trees treated with MeSA dispensers inside and companion plants around provided the most efficient pest control in orchards, compared with the opposite spatial arrangement.
4.The synthetic MeSA dispenser and the companion plant synergistically attracted ladybirds in the olfactometer and enhanced their flight activity in the flight mill.  In the wind-tunnel, MeSA served as a spatial cue for ladybirds to find nearby prey, while companion plants were sought in the absence of prey.
5.Synthesis and applications.  The present study will help further improvements of aphid control in apple orchards through a careful spatial arrangement of herbivore-induced plant volatiles dispensers (HIPVs) and rewards (companion plants) in optimized attract-and-reward strategies.  Without such assessment, these strategies may be hazardous even with well-identified targeted natural enemies.  Associated lab experiments highlight that HIPVs and companion plants interactively influence ladybird foraging pattern, and that their spatial arrangement can modulate the ability of such key predators to find their prey."

<p>ABSTRACT.&nbsp;Robust quantitative estimates of land use and land cover change are necessary to develop policy solutions and interventions aimed towards sustainable land management. Here, we evaluated the combination of Landsat and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate land use/cover change in the dynamic tropical landscape of Tanintharyi, southern Myanmar. We classified Landsat and L-band SAR data, specifically Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2), using Random Forests classifier to map and quantify land use/cover change transitions between 1995 and 2015 in the Tanintharyi Region. We compared the classification accuracies of single versus combined sensor data, and assessed contributions of optical and radar layers to classification accuracy. Combined Landsat and L-band SAR data produced the best overall classification accuracies (92.96% to 93.83%), outperforming individual sensor data (91.20% to 91.93% for Landsat-only; 56.01% to 71.43% for SAR-only). Radar layers, particularly SAR-derived textures, were influential predictors for land cover classification, together with optical layers. Landscape change was extensive (16,490 km<sup>2</sup>; 39% of total area), as well as total forest conversion into agricultural plantations (3,214 km<sup>2</sup>). Gross forest loss (5,133 km<sup>2</sup>) in 1995 was largely from conversion to shrubs/orchards and tree (oil palm, rubber) plantations, and gross gains in oil palm (5,471 km<sup>2</sup>) and rubber (4,025 km<sup>2</sup>) plantations by 2015 were mainly from conversion of shrubs/orchards and forests. Analysis of combined Landsat and L-band SAR data provides an improved understanding of the associated drivers of agricultural plantation expansion and the dynamics of land use/cover change in tropical forest landscapes.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.qfttdz0f1,open,Data from: Multi-species restoration accelerates recovery of extinguished oyster reefs,"<p>1. A multi-species approach to habitat restoration may boost the key processes (e.g. recruitment) that enable foundation species to overcome barriers to recovery. Natural systems tend to be formed by co-occurring foundation species whose synergy drives ecological productivity and resilience beyond that of single foundation species. Yet, restoration remains primarily a single-species focus enterprise where positive interactions are seldom incorporated into planning. A multi-species approach that prioritises species combinations to create emergent properties for their persistence may accelerate habitat recovery and the success of restoration programs.</p>

<p>2. On the largest oyster reef restoration project in the Southern Hemisphere, we experimentally established canopy-forming kelp to test whether they could accelerate the natural recruitment of oysters to substrata monopolised by turf-forming algae. To understand whether facilitation of oysters was a function of the kelp themselves (biological facilitation) or the physical environment they create (physical facilitation), we compared recruitment to the understorey of living kelp and synthetic kelp mimics.</p>

<p>3. Despite observing high density oyster recruitment to the turf-free underside of reef boulders (8,300 oysters/m2), turf algae appeared to inhibit oyster recruitment to the exposed surfaces of the reef, limiting their capacity to grow and form complex, three-dimensional habitat.</p>

<p>4. Transplanted kelp, whether living or synthetic kelp mimics, effectively reduced the biomass of turf and enhanced oyster recruitment, creating turf-free substrata on the upper reef surfaces with up to 26 times the oyster recruitment than turf-covered substrata.</p>

<p>5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide proof-of-concept that incorporating the transplant of canopy-forming kelp to reefs constructed to restore oysters is not only achievable, but may be imperative to successfully restore oyster reefs in turf-dominated systems. Kelp transplants supressed the turf algae that otherwise excluded oysters from the reef surface, effectively shifting the competitive advantage toward oyster recovery by maintaining bare substrata for oyster recruitment. In demonstrating that co-restoring foundation species facilitates interactions that overcome barriers to recovery, we emphasise the need for restoration programs to incorporate the functional synergy of overlapping foundation species into planning, so to establish emergent properties that can accelerate the recovery of restored habitat.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.1c59zw3rh,open,The extraterrestrial dust flux: size distribution and mass contribution estimates inferred from the Transantarctic Mountain (TAM) micrometeorite collection,"<p>This study explores the long-duration (0.8-2.3Ma), time-averaged micrometeorite flux (mass and size distribution) reaching Earth, as recorded by the Transantarctic Mountain (TAM) micrometeorite collection. We investigate a single sediment trap (TAM65), performing an exhaustive recovery and characterization effort and identifying 1643 micrometeorites (between 100-2000μm). Approximately 7% of particles are unmelted or scoriaceous, of which 75% are fine-grained. Among cosmic spherules, 95.6% are silicate-dominated S-types, and further subdivided into porphyritic (16.9%), barred olivine (19.9%), cryptocrystalline (51.6%) and vitreous (7.5%). Our (rank)-size distribution is fit against a power law with a slope of -3.9 (R<sup>2</sup>=0.98) over the size range 200-700μm. However, the distribution is also bimodal, with peaks centered at ~145μm and ~250μm. Remarkably similar peak positions are observed in the Larkman Nunatak data. These observations suggest that the micrometeorite flux is composed of multiple dust sources with distinct size distributions. In terms of mass, the TAM65 trap contains 1.77g of extraterrestrial dust in 15kg of sediment (&lt;5mm). Upscaling to a global annual estimate gives 1,555 (±753) t/yr – consistent with previous micrometeorite abundance estimates and almost identical to the previous South Pole Water Well flux estimate (~1,600 t/yr) and potentially suggesting minimal variation in the background cosmic dust flux over the Quaternary. The greatest uncertainty in our mass flux calculation is the accumulation window. A minimum age (0.8Ma) is robustly inferred from the presence of Australasian microtektites, while the upper age (~2.3Ma) is loosely constrained based on <sup>10</sup>Be exposure dating of glacial surfaces at Roberts Butte (6km from our sample site).</p>"
10.5061/dryad.45bf4,open,Data from: Division of labor as a bipartite network,"Bipartite ecological networks are increasingly used to described and model relationships between interacting species (e.g. plant-pollinator or host parasite). Here, we apply network methods developed in community ecology to quantify division of labor in insect societies. We consider two quantitative indices (H2' and d') derived from information theory that inform on how much the actual patterns of task performance deviates from the null expectation that workers perform tasks randomly. In addition, we computed network modularity to identify clusters of specialized individuals that are preferentially engaged in the completion of subset of available tasks. We analyzed both simple synthetic networks, varying in size and degree of specialization, and published datasets to introduce the metrics and to show that a bipartite approach provides useful insights into task allocation. Considering division of labor as a bipartite network offers a conceptual framework that could substantially increase our understanding of division of labor in animal societies."
10.7272/Q6CC0XXJ,open,DNA scaffolds enable efficient and tunable functionalization of biomaterials for immune cell modulation,"<p>Biomaterials can improve the safety and presentation of therapeutic agents for effective immunotherapy, and a high level of control over surface functionalization is essential for immune cell modulation. Here, we developed biocompatible immune cell engaging particles (ICEp) that use synthetic short DNA as scaffolds for efficient and tunable protein loading. To improve the safety of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, micron-sized ICEp were injected intratumorally to present a priming signal for systemically administered AND-gate CAR-T cells. Locally retained ICEp presenting a high density of priming antigens activated CAR-T cells, driving local tumor clearance while sparing uninjected tumors in immunodeficient mice. The ratiometric control of costimulatory ligands (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies) and the surface presentation of a cytokine (IL-2) on ICEp were shown to significantly impact human primary T cell activation phenotypes. This modular and versatile biomaterial functionalization platform can provide new opportunities for immunotherapies.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.f80bh,open,Data from: Increased survival of experimentally evolved antimicrobial peptide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in an animal host,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been proposed as new class of antimicrobial drugs, following the increasing prevalence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Synthetic AMPs are functional analogues of highly evolutionarily conserved immune effectors in animals and plants, produced in response to microbial infection. Therefore, the proposed therapeutic use of AMPs bears the risk of 'arming the enemy': bacteria that evolve resistance to AMPs may be cross-resistant to immune effectors (AMPs) in their hosts. We used a panel of populations of Staphylococcus aureus that were experimentally selected for resistance to a suite of individual AMPs and antibiotics to investigate the 'arming the enemy' hypothesis. We tested whether the selected strains showed higher survival in an insect model (Tenebrio molitor) and cross-resistance against other antimicrobials in vitro. A population selected for resistance to the antimicrobial peptide iseganan showed increased in vivo survival, but was not more virulent. We suggest that increased survival of AMP-resistant bacteria almost certainly poses problems to immune-compromised hosts."
10.5061/dryad.sj3tx9636,open,Mechanistic dissection of increased enzymatic rate in a phase-separated compartment,"<p><span>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into discrete cellular foci without an encapsulating membrane.  Condensates are often presumed to increase enzymatic reaction rates through increased concentrations of enzymes and substrates (mass action), although this idea has not been widely tested and other mechanisms of modulation are possible.  Here we describe a synthetic system where the SUMOylation enzyme cascade is recruited into engineered condensates generated by liquid-liquid phase separation of multidomain scaffolding proteins.  SUMOylation rates can be increased up to 36-fold in these droplets compared to the surrounding bulk, depending on substrate K<sub>M</sub>. This dependency produces substantial specificity among different substrates.  Analyses of reactions above and below the phase separation threshold lead to a quantitative model in which reactions in condensates are accelerated by mass action and by changes in substrate K<sub>M</sub>, likely due to scaffold-induced molecular organization. Thus, condensates can modulate reaction rates both by concentrating molecules and by physically organizing them.</span></p>"
10.5061/dryad.57tj1,open,Data from: Behavioural tuning in a tropical amphibian along an altitudinal gradient,"Males of the Coqui treefrog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, produce a distinct two-note 'co-qui' advertisement call from sunset to midnight throughout most of the year. Previous work established that both the spectrotemporal aspects of the call and the frequency of highest inner-ear sensitivity changes with altitude above sea level. These variations are such that the frequency of the emitted co-note closely matches the frequency to which the inner-ear is most sensitive. Given this parallel variation, we expected that the call-evoked behavioural response of male Coqui treefrogs would also show an altitude-dependence, and hypothesized that males would produce their most robust acoustical territorial response to advertisement calls that match calls from their own altitude. We tested this hypothesis in the field by studying the vocal response behaviour of Coquis to playbacks of synthetic, altitude-dependent conspecific calls, and indeed found that the most robust vocal responses were obtained using stimuli closely matching the calls from the same altitude."
10.6078/D1P09W,open,Kinesin and dynein use distinct mechanisms to bypass obstacles,"Kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic dynein are microtubule (MT) motors that transport intracellular cargos. It remains unclear how these motors move along MTs densely coated with obstacles of various sizes in the cytoplasm. Here, we tested the ability of single and multiple motors to bypass synthetic obstacles on MTs in vitro. Contrary to previous reports, we found that mammalian dynein is highly capable of bypassing obstacles. Human kinesin-1 motors fail to avoid obstacles, consistent with their inability to take sideways steps on to neighboring MT protofilaments. Kinesins overcome this limitation when working in teams, bypassing obstacles as effectively as multiple dyneins. Cargos driven by multiple kinesin or dyneins are also capable of rotating around the MT to bypass large obstacles. These results suggest that multiplicity of motors is required not only for transporting cargos over long distances and generating higher forces, but also for maneuvering of the cargos on obstacle-coated MT surfaces."
10.5061/dryad.478t9,open,Data from: Whole organism lineage tracing by combinatorial and cumulative genome editing,"Multicellular systems develop from single cells through distinct lineages. However, current lineage-tracing approaches scale poorly to whole, complex organisms. Here, we use genome editing to progressively introduce and accumulate diverse mutations in a DNA barcode over multiple rounds of cell division. The barcode, an array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 target sites, marks cells and enables the elucidation of lineage relationships via the patterns of mutations shared between cells. In cell culture and zebrafish, we show that rates and patterns of editing are tunable and that thousands of lineage-informative barcode alleles can be generated. By sampling hundreds of thousands of cells from individual zebrafish, we find that most cells in adult organs derive from relatively few embryonic progenitors. In future analyses, genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT) can be used to generate large-scale maps of cell lineage in multicellular systems for normal development and disease."

The composite was characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Brunner-Emmett-Teller measurements. The results showed that the MoS2 synthesized in the presence of PEG has the advantage of a larger surface area and that the adsorption effect of this MoS2 was enhanced. After extraction, the eight SAs were separated by capillary zone electrophoresis with a good linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.9902) in the range of 0.3-30 µg/mL and good precision (between 0.32% and 9.83%). Additionally, good recoveries (between 60.52% and 110.91%) were obtained for the SAs in the milk samples. The developed PEG@MoS2-based DSPE method could be applied for the enrichment of SAs in real milk samples."

However, no experiments have tested this theory. Here, we created synthetic cells to independently tune the frequency and feedback strength of a cell-cycle oscillator, enabling continuous mapping of period landscape in response to network perturbations. We found that although inhibiting positive feedback of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) reduces the tunability, the reduction is not as significant as theoretically predicted, and the Cdk1-counteracting phosphatase, PP2A, provides additional machinery to ensure frequency regulation. Additionally, cells exhibit polymorphic responses to PP2A inhibition, showing a monomodal distribution of oscillatory cells at low or high PP2A inhibition or a bimodal distribution at both low and high inhibitions. We explained the polymorphism by a model of two interlinked bistable switches of Cdk1 and PP2A where cell-cycle oscillations exhibit two modes in the presence or absence of PP2A bistability.</p>"

Identification of molecular drivers is hampered by the lack of suitable animal models. By performing RNA sequencing in livers from patients with different phenotypes of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), we show that the development of AH is characterized by the defective activity of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs). TGFb1is a key upstream transcriptome regulator in AH and induces the use of HNF4aP2 promoter in hepatocytes, which results in defective metabolic and synthetic functions. Gene polymorphisms in LETFs including HNF4aare not associated with the development of AH. In contrast, epigenetic studies show that AH livers have profound changes in DNA methylation state and chromatin remodeling, affecting HNF4a-dependent gene expression.&nbsp;We conclude that targeting TGFb1and epigenetic drivers that modulate HNF4a-dependent gene expression could be beneficial to improve hepatocellular function in patients with AH.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.4vg4k9h,open,Data from: Plant odour and sex pheromone are integral elements of specific mate recognition in an insect herbivore,"Specific mate recognition relies on the chemical senses in most animals, and especially in nocturnal insects. Two signal types mediate premating olfactory communication in terrestrial habitats: sex pheromones, which blend into an atmosphere of plant odorants. We show that host plant volatiles affect the perception of sex pheromone in males of the African cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis and that pheromone and plant volatiles are not perceived as independent messages. In clean air, S. littoralis males are attracted to single synthetic pheromone components or even the pheromone of a sibling species, Oriental cotton leafworm S. litura. Presence of host plant volatiles, however, reduces the male response to deficient or heterospecific pheromone signals. That plant cues enhance discrimination of sex pheromone quality confirms the idea that specific mate recognition in noctuid moths has evolved in concert with adaptation to host plants. Shifts in either female host preference or sex pheromone biosynthesis give rise to new communication channels that have the potential to initiate or contribute to reproductive isolation."

This might be particularly true for parasites, for which biotic rather than abiotic processes may play a primary role in structuring communities.  Focusing on vines, a group of structural parasites that gain access to the canopy using different climbing mechanisms, we examined the influence of abiotic factors in tandem with host-parasite and parasite-parasite interactions in the assembly of tropical vine communities.  Two synthetic variables, namely Climate1 and landscape Variety, were consistently important in explaining variation in species richness and diversity, as well as species composition, but their importance varied with scale. Whereas Climate1 summarizes the largest variability among climatic variables, landscape Variety expresses landscape heterogeneity within a neighborhood. Significant patterns of species co-occurrences suggest that vine-vine interactions also contribute to vine community assembly.  Our results may be critical to understand vine proliferation and help design management strategies for their control."

10.5061/dryad.23h5195,open,Data from: Genome duplication effects on functional traits and fitness are genetic context and species dependent: studies of synthetic polyploid Fragaria,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY Divergence in functional traits and adaptive responses to environmental change underlies the ecological advantage of polyploid plants in the wild. While established polyploids may benefit from combined outcomes of genome doubling, hybridization and polyploidy-enabled adaptive evolution, it remains less clear whether genome doubling alone can drive ecological divergence or whether the outcome is genetically variable.METHODS Using synthetic, colchicine-induced, autotetraploid (4x) plants derived from self-pollinated diploid (2x) seeds, and their colchicine-treated but unconverted diploid (2x.nc) full sibs from two diploid wild strawberry taxa (Fragaria vesca ssp. vesca and F. vesca ssp. bracteata), we examined the effects of genome doubling on functional traits, heat stress tolerance and fitness components across taxa and maternal families (i.e. genetic families) within taxa.KEY RESULTS Comparisons between 2x and 2x.nc plants indicated a negligible effect of colchicine treatment on functional traits. Genome doubling increased stomatal length, and decreased stomatal density, specific leaf area and leaf vein density, recapitulating patterns observed in wild polyploid Fragaria. Trichome density, heat stress tolerance and relative growth rate were not significantly affected by genome doubling. Although a reduction in clonal reproduction was observed in response to genome doubling, this effect was strongly genetic family dependent.CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that genome doubling during incipient speciation alone can generate ecological divergence and variation among genetic lineages. This response potentially allows for rapid short-term evolutionary adaptation and fuels genomic diversity and independent origins of polyploidy."

10.5061/dryad.9jj4f50,open,Data from: Increases and fluctuations in nutrient availability do not promote dominance of alien plants in synthetic communities of common natives,"<p>1. It is frequently thought that global environmental changes, and especially the concomitant changes in environmental variability, could further increase the success of invasive species in native resident communities. However, very few studies explicitly tested this, and it remains unknown whether invasive and non-invasive alien species respond differently to resource fluctuations in resident communities.</p>

<p>2. We grew ten invasive and ten non-invasive species as target species in pot-mesocosms with four different synthetic native resident communities under six nutrient treatments differing in overall nutrient availability and temporal fluctuations in nutrient supply (constant low, constant high, gradual increasing, gradual decreasing, single large pulse, multiple smaller pulses). With the exception of plants in the constant low treatment, the plants were supplied the same total amount of nutrients during the experiment. We tested whether high nutrient availability and fluctuations in nutrient supply increased performance of both invasive and non-invasive alien plants within native resident communities, and whether invasive ones benefited more than non-invasive ones.</p>

<p>3. We found that the increase in biomass in response to nutrient addition was stronger for invasive than for non-invasive alien species. However, as the native competitors benefited even more from nutrient addition, the relative biomass of the alien target plant species, particularly the non-invasive ones, decreased. When the nutrient supply gradually increased, biomass of alien targets as well as native competitors decreased compared to the plants in the constant nutrient supply treatment. Surprisingly, when nutrients were supplied as a single large pulse, the absolute and relative biomass of the alien target plants decreased. The reduction in relative biomass was even stronger for invasive than for non-invasive alien species, and a similar pattern was found when nutrients were supplied as multiple smaller pulses.</p>

<p>4. Our results confirm previous findings that invasive alien species benefit more from nutrient addition than non-invasive alien species. However, in contrast to previous findings, our results suggest that nutrient fluctuations can suppress biomass of alien plants relative to that of natives, at least when the natives are themselves very successful, common species.</p>"

We investigated their application in plasmonic sensing by modifying them with glucose oxidase and detection of glucose. The AuNSs were found to be a good scaffold for the enzyme, proved to stable and sensitive as transducers. Thus, the AuNSs showed good promise for further applications in plasmonic biosensing for in vivo biomedical diagnosis."
10.5061/dryad.4f8c0,open,Data from: When sensing is gambling: an experimental system reveals how plasticity can generate tunable bet-hedging strategies,"Genotypes can persist in unpredictable environments by 'hedging their bets' and producing diverse phenotypes. Theoretical studies have shown that the phenotypic variability needed for a bet-hedging strategy can be generated by factors either inside or outside an organism. However, sensing the environment and bet hedging are frequently treated as distinct evolutionary strategies. Furthermore, nearly all empirical studies of the molecular underpinnings of bet-hedging strategies to date have focused on internal sources of variability. We took a synthetic approach and constructed an experimental system where a phenotypic trade-off is mediated by actively sensing a cue present in the environment. We show that active sensing can generate a diversified bet-hedging strategy. Mutations affecting the norm of reaction to the cue alter the diversification strategy, indicating that bet hedging by active sensing is evolvable. Our results indicate that a broader class of biological systems should be considered as potential examples of bet-hedging strategies, and that research into the structure of environmental variability is needed to distinguish bet-hedging strategies from adaptive plasticity."
10.5061/dryad.4xgxd259g,open,Using machine learning to model nontraditional spatial dependence in occupancy data,"<p>Spatial models for occupancy data are used to estimate and map the true presence of a species, which may depend on biotic and abiotic factors as well as spatial autocorrelation. Traditionally researchers have accounted for spatial autocorrelation in occupancy data by using a correlated normally distributed site-level random effect, which might be incapable of modeling nontraditional spatial dependence such as discontinuities and abrupt transitions. Machine learning approaches have the potential to model nontraditional spatial dependence, but these approaches do not account for observer errors such as false absences. By combining the flexibility of Bayesian hierarchal modeling and machine learning approaches, we present a general framework to model occupancy data that accounts for both traditional and nontraditional spatial dependence as well as false absences. We demonstrate our framework using six synthetic occupancy data sets and two real data sets. Our results demonstrate how to model both traditional and nontraditional spatial dependence in occupancy data which enables a broader class of spatial occupancy models that can be used to improve predictive accuracy and model adequacy.</p>"
10.6078/D1F13S,open,The Ant Who Cried Wolf? Short-Term Repeated Exposure to Alarm Pheromone Reduces Behavioral Response in Argentine Ants,"In this study we test whether Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) progressively reduce their response to a salient stimulus (alarm pheromone) with increased exposure over time. First, we used a two-chamber olfactometer to demonstrate three focal behaviors of Argentine ants that indicate an alarmed state in response to conspecific alarm pheromone and pure synthetic iridomyrmecin (a dominant component of L. humile alarm pheromone). We then measured how these behaviors changed after repeated exposure to conspecific alarm pheromone from live ants. In addition, we investigate whether there is a difference in the ants' behavioral response after ""short"" (3 min) versus ""long"" (6 min) intervals between treatments. Our results show that Argentine ants do exhibit reduced responses to their own alarm pheromone, temporarily ceasing their response to it after four or five exposures, and this pattern holds whether exposure is repeated after ""short"" or ""long"" intervals. We suggest alarm pheromones may be perceived as false alarms unless threatening stimuli warrant a continued state of alarm. These results should be kept in mind while developing pheromone-based integrated pest management strategies."
10.5061/dryad.3j9kd51fb,open,Data from: Phylogenetic and functional distinctiveness explain alien plant population responses to competition,"Several invasion hypotheses predict a positive association between phylogenetic and functional distinctiveness of aliens and their performance, leading to the idea that distinct aliens compete less with their resident communities. However, synthetic pattern relationships between distinctiveness and alien performance and direct tests of competition as the driving mechanism have not been forthcoming. This is likely because different patterns are observed at different spatial grains, because functional trait and phylogenetic information are often incomplete, and due to the need for competition experiments that measure demographic responses across a variety of alien species that vary in their distinctiveness. We conduct a competitor removal experiment and parameterize matrix population and integral projection models for 14 alien plant species. More novel aliens compete less strongly with co-occurring species in their community, but these results dissipate at a larger spatial grain of investigation. Further, we find that functional traits used in conjunction with phylogeny improve our ability to explain competitive responses. Our investigation shows that competition is an important mechanism underlying the differential success of alien species."
10.5061/dryad.16m3n,open,Data from: Peptides derived from cadherin juxtamembrane region inhibit platelet function,"The juxtamembrane domains (JMD) of transmembrane proteins are rich in critical peptide sequences that participate in dynamic cell signaling events. Synthetic JMD peptides derived from cadherin cell adhesion proteins have previously been shown to modulate platelet function. In this study, we aimed to develop functional bioactive agents from bioinformatically-identified critical peptide sequences. We synthesized overlapping 12-15 amino acids peptides from E- and N-cadherin JMD and assessed their effect on platelet aggregation and platelet ATP secretion. Peptides derived from close to the membrane proximal region inhibit platelet function. Sequential deletion of amino acids from the N- and C-termini of the inhibitory E-cadherin peptides identified the short K756EPLLP763 motif as a critical bioactive sequence. Alanine scanning studies further identified that the dileucine (LL) motif and positively charged lysine (K) are crucial for peptide activity. Moreover, scrambled peptides failed to show any effect on platelet activity. We conclude that peptides derived from JMD of E-cadherin provide potential lead peptides for the development of anti-thrombotic agents and to enable further understanding of the role of cadherins in platelet function."
10.5061/dryad.306g8,open,"Data from: Synthesis, characterization and modelling of zinc and silicate co-substituted hydroxyapatite","Experimental chemistry and atomic modelling studies were performed here to investigate a novel ionic co-substitution in hydroxyapatite (HA). Zinc, silicate co-substituted HA (ZnSiHA) remained phase pure after heating to 1100°C with Zn and Si amounts of 0.6 wt% and 1.2 wt%, respectively. Unique lattice expansions in ZnSiHA, silicate Fourier transform infrared peaks and changes to the hydroxyl IR stretching region suggested Zn and silicate co-substitution in ZnSiHA. Zn and silicate insertion into HA was modelled using density functional theory (DFT). Different scenarios were considered where Zn substituted for different calcium sites or at a 2b site along the c-axis, which was suspected in singly substituted ZnHA. The most energetically favourable site in ZnSiHA was Zn positioned at a previously unreported interstitial site just off the c-axis near a silicate tetrahedron sitting on a phosphate site. A combination of experimental chemistry and DFT modelling provided insight into these complex co-substituted calcium phosphates that could find biomedical application as a synthetic bone mineral substitute."
10.5061/dryad.8363t,open,Data from: Shape variation in outline shapes,"A general morphometric method for describing shape variation in a sample consisting of landmarks and multiple outline shapes is developed in this paper. A distance metric is developed for such data and is used to embed the data in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. The Euclidean space is used to generate summary statistics such as mean and principal shape variation which are implicitly represented in the original space using elements of the sample. A new distance metric for outline shapes is proposed based on Procrustes distance that does not require the extraction of discrete points along the curve. The outline distant metric can be naturally combined with distances between landmarks. A method for aligning outlines and multiple outlines is developed that minimises the distance metric. The method is compared to semi-landmarks on synthetic data and two real data sets. Conclusion: outline methods produce useful and valid results when suitably constrained by landmarks and are useful visualisation aids, but questions remain about their suitability for answering biological questions until appropriate distance metrics can be biologically validated."

The current lack of interpretability often undermines the deployment of accurate machine learning tools in sensitive settings. In this work, we present a model-agnostic explanation method for image classification based on a hierarchical extension of Shapley coefficients&ndash;Hierarchical Shap (h-Shap)&ndash;that resolves some of the limitations of current approaches. Unlike other Shapley-based explanation methods, h-Shap is scalable and can be computed without the need of approximation. Under certain distributional assumptions, such as those common in multiple instance learning, h-Shap retrieves the exact Shapley coefficients with an exponential improvement in computational complexity. We compare our hierarchical approach with popular Shapley-based and non-Shapley-based methods on a synthetic dataset, a medical imaging scenario, and a general computer vision problem, showing that h-Shap outperforms the state of the art in both accuracy and runtime. Code and experiments are made publicly available.</p>"

This dataset provides idealized simulations from four LSMs (JULES, ORCHIDEE, JSBACH and CLM) that are harmonized with estimations obtained from satellite observations, enabling the inter-comparison and benchmarking of LSM performances and which can serve to identify model limitations and prioritize efforts in model development.

10.5061/dryad.f6p6n,open,Data from: Eating up the world's food web and the human trophic level,"Trophic levels are critical for synthesizing species' diets, depicting energy pathways, understanding food web dynamics and ecosystem functioning, and monitoring ecosystem health. Specifically, trophic levels describe the position of species in a food web, from primary producers to apex predators (range, 1–5). Small differences in trophic level can reflect large differences in diet. Although trophic levels are among the most basic information collected for animals in ecosystems, a human trophic level (HTL) has never been defined. Here, we find a global HTL of 2.21, i.e., the trophic level of anchoveta. This value has increased with time, consistent with the global trend toward diets higher in meat. National HTLs ranging between 2.04 and 2.57 reflect a broad diversity of diet, although cluster analysis of countries with similar dietary trends reveals only five major groups. We find significant links between socio-economic and environmental indicators and global dietary trends. We demonstrate that the HTL is a synthetic index to monitor human diets and provides a baseline to compare diets between countries."

This study employs a combination of common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments to determine whether leaf shape in Senecio lautus has evolved as an adaptive response to divergent natural selection. • We created a synthetic population of hybrid genotypes to segregate morphological variation between three ecotypes, and performed reciprocal transplants where this hybrid population was transplanted into the three adjacent native environments. We measured 9 leaf morphology traits across the experimental an natural populations at these sites . • We found significant divergence in multivariate leaf morphology toward the native character in each environment, suggesting environmental conditions at each site exert selective pressure that results in a phenotypic shift towards the local phenotype of the wild populations.• These associations suggest that differences in leaf morphology between S. lautus ecotypes has arisen as a result of divergent selection on leaf shape or associated traits that confer an adaptive advantage in each environment, which has led to the formation of morphologically distinct ecotypes."

The method relies on synchronous spectrofluorimety to solve the problem of the overlapping emission spectra of the studied drugs. Where, utilizing second derivative synchronous spectra enabled the simultaneous quantitation of bambuterol and montelukast without interference. The peak amplitudes of the aqueous solutions at Δλ = 20 nm were estimated at 284 nm &amp; 304 nm for bambuterol and at 374 nm &amp; 384 nm for montelukast. A linear relationship was achieved over the concentration range of 0.2–1.00 μg/mL for bambuterol and 0.4–2.00 μg/mL for montelukast. All factors and parameters were carefully studied to obtain the highest sensitivity and good precision of the proposed method. Additionally, the validation criteria were assessed in accordance with ICH guidelines.

Collectively these have become known as long COVID. Our aim was to first determine long COVID prevalence in 185 randomly surveyed COVID-19 patients and, subsequently, to determine if there was an association between occurrence of long COVID symptoms and reactivation of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in 68 COVID-19 patients recruited from those surveyed. We found the prevalence of long COVID symptoms to be 30.3% (56/185), which included 4 initially asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who later developed long COVID symptoms. Next, we found that 66.7% (20/30) of long COVID subjects versus 10% (2/20) of control subjects in our primary study group were positive for EBV reactivation based on positive titers for EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) IgG or EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM. The difference was significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, Fisher's exact test). A similar ratio was observed in a secondary group of 18 subjects 21–90 days after testing positive for COVID-19, indicating reactivation may occur soon after or concurrently with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that many long COVID symptoms may not be a direct result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but may be the result of COVID-19 inflammation-induced EBV reactivation.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.vj5np,open,Data from: The effects of synthetic estrogen exposure on pre-mating and post-mating episodes of selection in sex-role-reversed Gulf pipefish,"Environmental estrogens have been shown to affect populations of aquatic organisms in devastating ways, including feminization of males, alterations in mating behaviors, and disruption of sexual selection. Studies have shown 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) exposure to induce female-like secondary sexual traits in male Gulf pipefish, changing how females perceive affected males. We aimed to understand the effects of EE2 exposure on the sex-role-reversed mating system and the strength of selection in Gulf pipefish. We used artificial Gulf pipefish breeding aggregations and microsatellite-based parentage analysis to determine maternity. We then calculated the opportunity for selection and selection differentials on body size for both sexes during three consecutive episodes of selection. Exposure to EE2 did not affect the strength of selection, likely due to the unusual sex-role-reversed mating system found in this species. With respect to multiply mated females, EE2 exposed females produced more eggs with higher embryo survivorship than non-exposed females. Thus, short-term exposure to low concentrations (2.0 ng/L) of EE2 in Gulf pipefish enhanced female reproductive success. However, higher EE2 concentrations (5.0 ng/L) caused complete reproductive failure in Gulf pipefish males. These results call for more work on the long-term effects of EE2 exposure in Gulf pipefish in artificial and natural populations."

The Role of Regional Connections in Planning for Future Power System Operations under Climate Extremes


Abstract:

Extreme climate events can negatively impact power system operations. Identifying the sensitivity of a power system to climate extremes must consider future infrastructure changes. We investigate the sensitivity of a historic Western U.S. power system (5% variable renewable penetration of energy) and a future system (31%) to compound drought and heat wave events.  We use an electricity operational model combined with a model of historically extreme drought (for hydropower and freshwater-reliant thermoelectric generators) over the Western U.S. and a synthetic, regionally extreme heat event focused on Southern California (for thermoelectric generators and electricity load). We find that drought has the highest impact on summertime production cost (+10 to +12%), while temperature-based deratings have minimal effect (at most +1%).  The heat wave scenario impacting load increases the summertime regional net imports to that region by 10 to 14%, while the drought decreases them by 5 to 12%. Combined heat and drought conditions have a moderate effect on imports to Southern California (-2%) in the historic system and a stronger effect (+8%) in the future system. Southern California dependence on other regions decreases in the summertime with the moderate increase in variable renewable energy (-34% imports), but hourly peak regional imports are maintained under those infrastructure changes. Using a novel method that combines synthetic and historically-driven conditions to test multiple infrastructures, we consolidate the importance of considering compounded heat wave and drought in planning studies and show that region-to-region energy transfers during peak periods are key to optimal operations under climate extremes.

10.5281/zenodo.5703837,open,Identification of beneficial and detrimental bacteria that impact sorghum responses to drought using multi-scale and multi-system microbiome comparisons,"<p><strong>Background: </strong>Drought is a major abiotic stress that limits agricultural productivity. Previous field-level experiments have demonstrated that drought decreases microbiome diversity in the root and rhizosphere and may lead to enrichment of specific groups of microbes, such as <em>Actinobacteria</em>. How these changes ultimately affect plant health is not well understood. In parallel, model systems have been used to tease apart the specific interactions between plants and single, or small groups of microbes. However, translating this work into crop species and achieving increased crop yields within noisy field settings remains a challenge. Thus, the next scientific leap forward in microbiome research must cross the great lab-to-field divide. Toward this end, we combined reductionist, transitional and ecological approaches, applied to the staple cereal crop sorghum to identify key beneficial and detrimental, root associated microbes that robustly affect drought stressed plant phenotypes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Results: </strong>Fifty-three bacterial strains, originally characterized for association with <em>Arabidopsis</em>, were applied to sorghum seeds and their effect on root growth was monitored for seven days. Two <em>Arthrobacter </em>strains, members of the <em>Actinobacteria </em>phylum, caused root growth inhibition (RGI) in <em>Arabidopsis</em> and sorghum. In the context of synthetic communities, strains of <em>Variovorax</em> were able to protect both <em>Arabidopsis </em>and sorghum from the RGI caused by <em>Arthrobacter</em>. As a transitional system, we tested the synthetic communities through a 24-day high-throughput sorghum phenotyping assay and found that during drought stress, plants colonized by <em>Arthrobacter</em> were significantly smaller and had reduced leaf water content as compared to control plants. However, plants colonized by both <em>Arthrobacter</em> and <em>Variovorax</em> performed as well or better than control plants. In parallel, we performed a field trial wherein sorghum was evaluated across well-watered and drought conditions. Drought responsive microbes were identified, including an enrichment in <em>Actinobacteria</em>, consistent with previous findings. By incorporating data on soil properties into the microbiome analysis, we accounted for experimental noise with a newly developed method and were then able to observe that the abundance of <em>Arthrobacter</em> strains negatively correlated with plant growth. Having validated this approach, we cross-referenced datasets from the high-throughput phenotyping and field experiments and report a list of high confidence bacterial taxa that positively associated with plant growth under drought stress.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>A three-tiered experimental system connected reductionist and ecological approaches and identified beneficial and deleterious bacterial strains for sorghum under drought stress.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.1s53q,open,Data from: Nutritional imbalance suppresses migratory phenotypes of the Mongolian locust (Oedaleus asiaticus),"For many species, migration evolves to allow organisms to access better resources. However, the proximate factors that trigger these developmental changes, and how and why these vary across species, remain poorly understood. One prominent hypothesis is that poor-quality food promotes development of migratory phenotypes and this has been clearly shown for some polyphenic insects. In other animals, particularly long-distance bird migrants, it is clear that high-quality food is required to prepare animals for a successful migration. We tested the effect of diet quality on the flight behaviour and morphology of the Mongolian locust, Oedaleus asiaticus. Locusts reared at high population density and fed low-N grass (performance-enhancing for this species) had enhanced migratory morphology relative to locusts fed high-N grass. Furthermore, locusts fed synthetic diets with an optimal 1 : 2 protein : carbohydrate ratio flew for longer times than locusts fed diets with lower or higher protein : carbohydrate ratios. In contrast to the hypothesis that performance-degrading food should enhance migration, our results support the more nuanced hypothesis that high-quality diets promote development of migratory characteristics when migration is physiologically challenging."

In an attempt to circumvent these constraints, we investigated the susceptibility of C. maculatus to 2, 3-Dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP) and Lippia adoensis essential oil (EO) and then assessed the variations in the proportions of nutritional values of treated grains 150 days after storage. The survival rate was recorded after 5 generations. The resistance index and biochemical parameters of grains were determined according to previously described techniques. The survival rate (SR) and resistance index (RI50 and RI95) significantly increased in DDVP treatments (r=0.889; p=0.018) proportionally with damage whereas in EO treatments, those values remained lower although showed a slight but not significant variations (p=0.0764) throughout generations. DDVP stored grains yielded higher crude protein values, but lower carbohydrates, tannins, phenolics and minerals compared to EO. Eighteen amino acids were detected in EO treated grains and 14 in DDVP which was devoid of albumin and prolamin. EO could therefore represent a safe alternative bio-pesticide to cope with the insect resistance and enhance the nutritional qualities of stored cowpea seeds."

Here, we develop a novel synthetic human reference sequence that is ethnically concordant and use it for the analysis of genomes from a nuclear family with history of familial thrombophilia. We demonstrate that the use of the major allele reference sequence results in improved genotype accuracy for disease-associated variant loci. We infer recombination sites to the lowest median resolution demonstrated to date (&lt;1,000 base pairs). We use family inheritance state analysis to control sequencing error and inform family-wide haplotype phasing, allowing quantification of genome-wide compound heterozygosity. We develop a sequence-based methodology for Human Leukocyte Antigen typing that contributes to disease risk prediction. Finally, we advance methods for analysis of disease and pharmacogenomic risk across the coding and non-coding genome that incorporate phased variant data. We show these methods are capable of identifying multigenic risk for inherited thrombophilia and informing the appropriate pharmacological therapy. These ethnicity-specific, family-based approaches to interpretation of genetic variation are emblematic of the next generation of genetic risk assessment using whole-genome sequencing."

Current control relies almost entirely on ivermectin, which suppresses symptoms caused by the first-stage larvae (microfilariae) but does not kill the long-lived adults. Here, we evaluated emodepside, a semi-synthetic cyclooctadepsipeptide registered for deworming applications in companion animals, for activity against adult filariae (<i>i.e</i>., as a macrofilaricide). We demonstrate the equivalence of emodepside activity on SLO-1 potassium channels in <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> and <i>Onchocerca ochengi</i>, its sister species from cattle. Evaluation of emodepside in cattle as single or 7-day treatments at two doses (0.15 and 0.75 mg/kg) revealed rapid activity against microfilariae, prolonged suppression of female worm fecundity, and macrofilaricidal effects by 18 months post treatment. The drug was well tolerated, causing only transiently increased blood glucose. Female adult worms were mostly paralyzed; however, some retained metabolic activity even in the multiple high-dose group. These data support ongoing clinical development of emodepside to treat river blindness.</p>"

Open science databases have facilitated comprehensive and synthetic analyses of past fire activity, but charcoal datasets must be standardized (scaled) because of variations in measurement strategy, sediment type, and catchment size.  Here, we: i) assess how commonly used metrics of charcoal scaling perform on datasets from tropical forests; ii) introduce a new method called proportional relative scaling, which down-weights rare and infrequent fire; and iii) compare the approaches using charcoal data from four lakes in the Peruvian Amazon. We found that Z-score transformation and relative scaling (existing methods) distorted the structure of the charcoal peaks within the record, inflating the variation in small-scale peaks and minimizing the effect of large peaks. Proportional relative scaling maintained the structure of the original non-scaled data and contained zero values for the absence of fire. Proportional relative scaling provides an alternative scaling approach when the absence of fire is central to the aims of the research or when charcoal is infrequent and occurs in low abundances.</p>"

This ability is conditioned not only by the existence of well-studied synthetic protocols but also by the availability of corresponding reagents, so-called building blocks (BB). In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the chemical space of 400K purchasable BB. The chemical space was defined by corresponding synthons &ndash; fragments contributed to the final molecules upon reaction. They allow an analysis of BB physicochemical properties and diversity, unbiased by the leaving and protective groups in actual reagents. The main classes of BB were analyzed in terms of their availability, rule-of-two-defined quality, and diversity. Available BBs were eventually compared to a reference set of biologically relevant synthons derived from ChEMBL fragmentation, in order to illustrate how well they cover the actual medicinal chemistry needs. This was performed on a newly constructed universal generative topographic map of synthon chemical space, allowing to visualize both libraries and analyze their overlapping and library-specific regions.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.4269941,open,Meniscus Matrix Remodeling in Response to Compressive Forces in Dogs,"<p>Joint motion and postnatal stress of weight bearing are the principal factors that determine the phenotypical and architectural changes that characterize the maturation process of the meniscus. In this study, the effect of compressive forces on the meniscus will be evaluated in a litter of 12 Dobermann Pinschers, of approximately 2 months of age, euthanized as affected by the quadriceps contracture muscle syndrome of a single limb focusing on extracellular matrix remodeling and cell-extracellular matrix interaction (i.e., meniscal cells maturation, collagen fibers typology and arrangement). The affected limbs were considered as models of continuous compression while the physiologic loaded limbs were considered as controls. The results of this study suggest that a compressive continuous force, applied to the native meniscal cells, triggers an early maturation of the cellular phenotype, at the expense of the proper organization of collagen fibers. Nevertheless, an application of a compressive force could be useful in the engineering process of meniscal tissue in order to induce a faster achievement of the mature cellular phenotype and, consequently, the earlier production of the fundamental extracellular matrix (ECM), in order to improve cellular viability and adhesion of the cells within a hypothetical synthetic scaffold.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.s31v04d,open,Data from: Honeybees possess a structurally diverse and functionally redundant set of queen pheromones,"Queen pheromones, which signal the presence of a fertile queen and induce workers to remain sterile, play a key role in regulating reproductive division of labour in insect societies. In the honeybee, volatiles produced by the queen's mandibular glands have been argued to act as the primary sterility-inducing pheromones. This contrasts with evidence from other groups of social insects, where specific queen-characteristic hydrocarbons present on the cuticle act as conserved queen signals. This led us to hypothesise that honeybee queens might also employ cuticular pheromones to stop workers from reproducing. Here we support this hypothesis with the results of bioassays with synthetic blends of queen-characteristic alkenes, esters, and carboxylic acids. We show that all these compound classes suppress worker ovary development, and that one of the blends of esters that we used was as effective as the queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) mix. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two main QMP compounds 9-ODA and 9-HDA tested individually were as effective as the blend of all four major QMP compounds, suggesting considerable signal redundancy. Possible adaptive reasons for the observed complexity of the honeybee queen signal mix are discussed."

For spatial data, prediction of these missing observations should be informed by within location association among outcomes and by proximate locations where measurements were recorded. This study details and illustrates a Bayesian regression framework for modelling spatially misaligned multivariate data. Particular attention is paid to developing valid probability models capable of estimating parameter posterior distributions and propagating uncertainty through to outcomes' predictive distributions at locations where some or all of the outcomes are not observed. Models and associated software are presented for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian outcomes. Model parameter and predictive inference within the proposed framework is illustrated using a synthetic and forest inventory data set. The proposed Markov chain Monte carlo samplers were written in c++ and leverage R's Foreign Language Interface to call fortran blas (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and lapack (Linear Algebra Package) libraries for efficient matrix computations.

Finally, we apply the algorithm to two single-particle-tracking photo-activated localization microscopy biological datasets, acquired from living primary cells with very high temporal rates. Our analysis of the dynamics of very large cohorts of 10 000 s of membrane-associated protein molecules show that they behave as if caged in nanodomains. We show that the robustness and efficiency of our method provides a tool for the examination of single-molecule behaviour with unprecedented spatial detail and high acquisition rates."

To combat this, we have designed a new class of Meldrum-based phenolic UV-A filters. We explore the ultrafast photodynamics of coumaryl Meldrum, CMe, and sinapyl Meldrum, SMe, both in an industry standard emollient and on a synthetic skin mimic, using femtosecond transient electronic and vibrational absorption spectroscopies, and computational simulations. Upon photoexcitation to the lowest excited singlet state (S<sub>1</sub>), these Meldrum-based phenolics undergo fast and efficient non-radiative decay to repopulate the electronic ground state (S<sub>0</sub>). We propose an initial ultrafast twisted intramolecular charge transfer mechanism as these systems evolve out of the Franck-Condon region towards an S<sub>1</sub>/S<sub>0</sub> conical intersection, followed by internal conversion to S<sub>0</sub> and subsequent vibrational cooling. Importantly, we correlate these findings to their long-term photostability upon irradiation with a solar simulator and conclude that these molecules surpass the basic requirements of an industry standard UV filter.</p>"

10.6071/M3D95S,open,Assessing the impact of product inhibition in a chromogenic assay,"<p>Chromogenic substrates (CS) are synthetic substrates used to monitor the activity of a target enzyme. It has been reported that some CSs display competitive product inhibition with their target enzyme. Thus, in assays where enzyme activity is continuously monitored over long periods of time, the product inhibition may significantly interfere with the reactions being monitored. Despite this knowledge, it is rare for CSs to be directly incorporated into mathematical models that simulate these assays. This devalues the predictive power of the models. In this study, we examined the interactions between a single enzyme, coagulation factor Xa, and its chromogenic substrate. We developed, and experimentally validated, a mathematical model of a chromogenic assay for factor Xa that explicitly included product inhibition from the CS. We employed Bayesian inference, in the form of Markov-Chain Monte Carlo, to estimate the strength of the product inhibition and other sources of uncertainty such as pipetting error and kinetic rate constants. Our model, together with carefully calibrated biochemistry experiments, allowed for full characterization of the strength and impact of product inhibition in the assay.  The effect of CS product inhibition in more complex reaction mixtures was further explored using mathematical models.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.bb5dr437,open,Data from: A significant component of ageing (DNA damage) is reflected in fading breeding colors: an experimental test using innate antioxidant mimetics in painted dragon lizards,"A decade ahead of their time, von Schantz and coworkers united sexual selection and free radical biology by identifying causal links between deep-rooted physiological processes that dictate resistance to toxic waste from oxidative metabolism (reactive oxygen species), and phenotypic traits, such as ornaments. Ten years later, these ideas have still only been tested with indirect estimates of free radical levels (oxidative stress) subsequent to the action of innate and dietary antioxidants. Here we measure net superoxide (a selection pressure for antioxidant production) and experimentally manipulate superoxide antioxidation using a synthetic mimetic of superoxide dismutase, Eukarion 134 (EUK). We then measure the toxic effect of superoxide in terms of DNA erosion and concomitant loss of male breeding coloration in the lizard, Ctenophorus pictus. Control males suffered more DNA damage than EUK-males. Spectroradiometry showed that male coloration is lost in relation to superoxide and covaries with DNA erosion; in control males these variables explained 72 % of color loss, whereas in EUK males, the fading of coloration was unaffected by superoxide and unrelated to DNA damage. Thus, EUK's powerful antioxidation removes the erosion effect of superoxide on coloration and experimentally verifies the prediction that colors reflect innate capacity for antioxidation."

Positive interactions are sensitive to human impacts, necessitating synthetic approaches to elucidate broad patterns and predict future changes if these interactions are altered or lost.  We conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate the magnitude of positive interactions across freshwater habitats. In 340 studies, we found substantial positive effects, with facilitators increasing beneficiaries by, on average, 81% across all taxa and response variables. Mollusks in particular were commonly studied as both facilitators and beneficiaries. Amphibians were one group benefiting the most from positive interactions, yet amphibians were not commonly studied. Invasive facilitators had stronger positive effects on beneficiaries than native facilitators. We compared positive effects between high and low stress conditions (<i>n</i> = 13) and found no difference in the magnitude of benefit. Future areas of research include understudied facilitators and beneficiaries, the stress gradient hypothesis, patterns across space or time, and the influence of declining taxa whose elimination would jeopardize fragile positive interaction networks. Freshwater positive interactions occur among a wide range of taxa, influence populations, communities, and ecosystem processes, and deserve further exploration</p>"
10.5061/dryad.6hdr7sqw5,open,Cellular dialogues that enable self-organization of dynamic spatial patterns,"<p>Cells form spatial patterns by coordinating their gene expressions. How a group of mesoscopic numbers (hundreds-to-thousands) of cells, without pre-defined morphogens and spatial organization, self-organizes spatial patterns remains incompletely understood. Of particular importance are dynamic spatial patterns - such as spiral waves that perpetually move and transmit information over macroscopic length-scales. We developed an open-source, expandable software that can simulate a field of cells communicating with any number of cell-secreted molecules in any manner. With it and a theory developed here, we identified all possible ""cellular dialogues"" - ways of communicating with two diffusing molecules - and core architectures underlying them that enable diverse, self-organized dynamic spatial patterns that we classified. The patterns form despite widely varying cellular response to the molecules, gene-expression noise, and spatial arrangement and motility of cells. Three-stage, ""order-fluctuate-settle"" process forms dynamic spatial patterns: cells form long-lived whirlpools of wavelets that, through chaos-like interactions, settle into a dynamic spatial pattern. These results provide a blueprint to help identify missing regulatory links for observed dynamic-pattern formations and in building synthetic tissues.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.87tk7,open,Data from: Community composition affects the shape of mate response functions,"The evolution of mate preferences can be critical for the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. Heterospecific interference may carry substantial fitness costs and result in preferences where females are most responsive to the mean conspecific trait with low response to traits that differ from this value. However, when male traits are unbounded by heterospecifics, there may not be selection against females that respond to extreme trait values in the unbounded direction. To test how heterospecifics affected the shape of female response functions, I presented female Oecanthus tree crickets with synthetic calls representing a range of male calls, then measured female phonotaxis to construct response functions. The species with the fastest pulse rates in the community consistently responded to pulse rates faster than those produced by their males, while in the intermediate and slowest pulse rate species there was no significant difference between the male trait and the female response. This work suggests that species with the most extreme signal in the community respond to a greater range of signals, potentially resulting in a higher probability of hybridization during secondary contact, and revealing interactions between mate recognition and other aspects of sexual selection."

10.5061/dryad.c394c12,open,Data from: Divergence in sex peptide-mediated female post-mating responses in Drosophila melanogaster,"Transfer and receipt of seminal fluid proteins crucially affect reproductive processes in animals. Evolution in these male ejaculatory proteins is explained with post-mating sexual selection, but we lack a good understanding of the evolution of female post-mating responses to these proteins. Some of these proteins are expected to mediate sexually antagonistic coevolution generating the expectation that females evolve resistance. One candidate in Drosophila melanogaster is the sex peptide (SP) which confers cost of mating in females. Here, we compared female SP-induced post-mating responses across three D. melanogaster wild type populations after mating with SP-lacking versus control males including fitness measures. Surprisingly, we did not find any evidence for SP-mediated fitness costs in any of the populations. However, female lifetime reproductive success and lifespan were differently affected by SP receipt indicating that female post-mating responses diverged among populations. Injection of synthetic SP into virgin females further supports these findings and suggests that females from different populations require different amounts of SP to effectively initiate post-mating responses. Molecular analyses of the sex peptide receptor suggest that genetic differences might explain the observed phenotypical divergence. We discuss the evolutionary processes that might have caused this divergence in female post-mating responses."
10.5061/dryad.7nh05k6,open,Data from: Integration of homogeneous structural region identification and rock mass quality classification,"In rock engineering projects, professionals assess the overall rock mass qualities using a sole value. However, the true qualities of partial rock masses are incompatible with such a value. To address this problem, the idea of regionally classifying rock mass qualities is proposed and the associated procedure presented. To achieve this goal, the probabilistic and deterministic joints within the study area were determined, and a three-dimensional joint network model was created. Then, the three-dimensional joint network model was discretised into interlocking subdomains, and the modified blockiness index (MBi) was used to finely identify the homogeneous structural regions, together with the k-means algorithm and the sum of squared errors (SSE). A synthetic model comprising homogeneous structural regions was developed and validated with respect to the extracted cross-sections. Next, an improved Rock Mass Rating system (RMRmbi) was introduced, and the viability of RMRmbi was supported through a significant amount of theoretical cases and several real cases. Finally, visualisation of regional RMRmbi classification results was performed. Results show that: (i) the homogeneous structural regions are finely demarcated in three dimensions; and (ii) the proposed idea can overcome the problem of rock mass quality classification using the conventional approach often leading to 'overgeneralisation'."
10.5061/dryad.fp1bg,open,Data from: Select and resequence reveals relative fitness of bacteria in symbiotic and free-living environments,"Assays to accurately estimate relative fitness of bacteria growing in multistrain communities can advance our understanding of how selection shapes diversity within a lineage. Here, we present a variant of the ""evolve and resequence"" approach both to estimate relative fitness and to identify genetic variants responsible for fitness variation of symbiotic bacteria in free-living and host environments. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by characterizing selection by two plant hosts and in two free-living environments (sterilized soil and liquid media) acting on synthetic communities of the facultatively symbiotic bacterium Ensifer meliloti. We find (i) selection that hosts exert on rhizobial communities depends on competition among strains, (ii) selection is stronger inside hosts than in either free-living environment, and (iii) a positive host-dependent relationship between relative strain fitness in multistrain communities and host benefits provided by strains in single-strain experiments. The greatest changes in allele frequencies in response to plant hosts are in genes associated with motility, regulation of nitrogen fixation, and host/rhizobia signaling. The approach we present provides a powerful complement to experimental evolution and forward genetic screens for characterizing selection in bacterial populations, identifying gene function, and surveying the functional importance of naturally occurring genomic variation."

Animal movement patterns contribute to our understanding of variation in breeding success and survival of individuals, and the implications for population dynamics.
2. Over time, sensor technology for measuring movement patterns has improved.
Although older technologies may be rendered obsolete, the existing data are still valuable, especially if new and old data can be compared to test whether a behavior has changed over time.
3. We used simulated data to assess the ability to quantify and correctly identify patterns of seabird flight lengths under observational regimes used in successive generations of wet/dry logging technology.
4. Care must be taken when comparing data collected at differing time-scales, even when using inference procedures that incorporate the observational process, as model selection and parameter estimation may be biased. In practice, comparisons may only be valid when degrading all data to match the lowest resolution in a set.
5. Changes in tracking technology, such as the wet/dry loggers explored here, that lead to aggregation of measurements at different temporal scales make comparisons challenging. We therefore urge ecologists to use synthetic data to assess whether accurate parameter estimation is possible for models comparing disparate data sets before planning experiments and conducting analyses such as responses to environmental changes or the assessment of management actions."
10.5061/dryad.ms12t45,open,Data from: Sex-specific changes in gene expression in response to estrogen pollution around the onset of sex differentiation in grayling (Salmonidae),"The synthetic 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a common estrogenic pollutant that has been suspected to affect the demography of river-dwelling salmonids. One possibility is that exposure to EE2 tips the balance during initial steps of sex differentiation, so that male genotypes show female-specific gene expression and gonad formation. Here we study EE2 effects on gene expression around the onset of sex differentiation in a population of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) that suffers from sex ratio distortions. We exposed singly-raised embryos to one dose of 1 ng/L EE2, studied gene expression 10 days before hatching, at the day of hatching, and around the end of the yolk-sac stage, and related it to genetic sex (sdY genotype). We found that exposure to EE2 affects expression of a large number of genes, especially around hatching. These effects were strongly sex-dependent. We then raised fish for several months after hatching and found no evidence of sex reversal in the EE2-exposed fish. We conclude that ecologically relevant (i.e. low) levels of EE2 pollution do not cause sex reversal by simply tipping the balance at early stages of sex differentiation, but that they interfere with sex-specific gene expression."

The development of pharmaceutical foams that exhibit desirable foaming properties, delivering appropriate amounts of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and that have excellent biocompatibility is of great interest. The production of stable foams is rare in the natural world; however, certain species of frogs have adopted foam production as a means of providing a protective environment for their eggs and larvae from a predators and parasites, to prevent desiccation, to control gaseous exchange, temperature extremes, and to reduce UV damage. These foams show great stability (up to 10 days in tropical environments) and are highly biocompatible due to the sensitive nature of amphibian skin. This work demonstrates for the first time, that nests of the Túngara frog (<i>Engystomops pustulosus</i>) is stable <i>ex situ</i> with useful physiochemical and biocompatible properties and is capable of encapsulating a range of compounds, including antibiotics.

After finding a range of Gyrase concentrations where the inverse of the transcription rate of a chromosome-integrated gene changes linearly with the inverse of Gyrase concentration, we apply a Line Weaver-Burk plot to dissect the expected in vivo transcription rate in absence of PSB. We validate the estimation by time-lapse microscopy of single-RNA production kinetics of the same gene when single-copy plasmid-borne, shown to be impervious to Gyrase inhibition. Next, we estimate the fraction of time in locked states and number of transcription events prior to locking, which we validate by measurements under Gyrase inhibition. Replacing the gene of interest by one with slower transcription rate decreases the fraction of time in locked states due to PSB. Finally, we combine data from both constructs to infer a range of possible transcription initiation locking kinetics in a chromosomal location, obtainable by tuning the transcription rate. We validate with measurements of transcription activity at different induction levels. This strategy for dissecting transcription initiation locking kinetics due to PSB can contribute to resolve the transcriptional programs of E. coli and in the engineering of synthetic genetic circuits.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.m37pvmczd,open,Supplemental material from: ESR1 mutations associated with EIS change conformation of ligand receptor complex and alter transcriptome profile,"Estrogen insensitivity syndrome (EIS) arises from rare mutations in estrogen receptor α (ERα, encoded by ESR1 gene) resulting in the inability of estrogen to exert its biological effects. Due to the rarity, mutations in ESR1 gene and the underlying molecular mechanisms of EIS have not been thoroughly studied. Here, we investigate known ESR1 mutants, Q375H and R394H, associated with EIS patients using in vitro and in vivo systems. Comparison of the transcriptome and DNA methylome from stable cell lines of both Q375H and R394H clinical mutants show a differential profile compared to WT ERα resulting in loss of estrogen-responsiveness. Molecular dynamic simulation shows that both ESR1 mutations change the ERα conformation of the ligand receptor complexes. Furthermore, we generated a mouse model Esr1-Q, harboring the human mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Female and male Esr1-Q mice are infertile and have similar phenotypes to αERKO mice. Overall phenotypes of the Esr1-Q mice correspond to those observed in the Q375H patient. Finally, we explore the effects of a synthetic progestogen and a GnRH inhibitor in the Esr1-Q mice for potentially reversing the impaired female reproductive tract function. These findings provide an important basis for understanding the molecular mechanistic consequences associated with EIS."
10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzsfs,open,Polyploidy and Mutation in Arabidopsis,"<p class=""western"">The effects of genetic mutations are influenced by genome structure. Polyploids have more gene or allele copies than diploids, which results in higher tolerance of recessive deleterious mutations. However, this benefit may differ between autopolyploids and allopolyploids and between neopolyploids and older polyploid lineages due to the effects of hybridization and diploidization, respectively. To isolate these effects, we measured the impacts of controlled mutagenesis on reproductive fitness traits in closely related <i>Arabidopsis</i> diploids (<i>A. thaliana</i>), autotetraploids (<i>A. thaliana</i>), and allotetraploids<i> </i>(<i>A. suecica</i>), including both synthetic and natural polyploid lines. Overall, mutagenesis had the largest negative impacts on seed production, while its impacts on germination and survival were negligible. As expected, these effects were much stronger in diploids than in polyploids. The differences between autopolyploids, allopolyploids, and polyploids of different ages were minor—cumulative reproductive fitness did not significantly differ between the treatment and control groups for any polyploid line type. These results suggest that hybridization and polyploid age have not impacted the genomic redundancy of <i>Arabidopsis</i> polyploids enough to significantly alter their aggregate response to mutation, although this effect may differ in older polyploid lineages or in allopolyploids with different levels of divergence between parental subgenomes.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.58q00,open,Data from: Pertussis immunity and epidemiology: mode and duration of vaccine-induced immunity,"The resurgence of pertussis in some countries that maintain high vaccination coverage has drawn attention to gaps in our understanding of the epidemiological effects of pertussis vaccines. In particular, major questions surround the nature, degree and durability of vaccine protection. To address these questions, we used mechanistic transmission models to examine regional time series incidence data from Italy in the period immediately following the introduction of acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine. Our results concur with recent animal-challenge experiments wherein infections in aP-vaccinated individuals proved as transmissible as those in naive individuals but much less symptomatic. On the other hand, the data provide evidence for vaccine-driven reduction in susceptibility, which we quantify via a synthetic measure of vaccine impact. As to the precise nature of vaccine failure, the data do not allow us to distinguish between leakiness and waning of vaccine immunity, or some combination of these. Across the range of well-supported models, the nature and duration of vaccine protection, the age profile of incidence and the range of projected epidemiological futures differ substantially, underscoring the importance of the remaining unknowns. We identify key data gaps: sources of data that can supply the information needed to eliminate these remaining uncertainties."
10.5061/dryad.5h17h,open,Data from: Genetic basis of priority effects: insights from nectar yeast,"Priority effects, in which the order of species arrival dictates community assembly, can have a major influence on species diversity, but the genetic basis of priority effects remains unknown. Here, we suggest that nitrogen scavenging genes previously considered responsible for starvation avoidance may drive priority effects by causing rapid resource depletion. Using single-molecule sequencing, we de novo assembled the genome of the nectar-colonizing yeast, Metschnikowia reukaufii, across eight scaffolds and complete mitochondrion, with gap-free coverage over gene spaces. We found a high rate of tandem gene duplication in this genome, enriched for nitrogen metabolism and transport. Both high-capacity amino acid importers, GAP1 and PUT4, present as tandem gene arrays, were highly expressed in synthetic nectar and regulated by the availability and quality of amino acids. In experiments with competitive nectar yeast, Candida rancensis, amino acid addition alleviated suppression of C. rancensis by early arrival of M. reukaufii, corroborating that amino acid scavenging may contribute to priority effects. Because niche pre-emption via rapid resource depletion may underlie priority effects in a broad range of microbial, plant and animal communities, nutrient scavenging genes like the ones we considered here may be broadly relevant to understanding priority effects."

Such variation could be caused by the immunomodulatory effects of gonadal steroids. Here we assess the influence of gonadal steroids on the ability of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to defend themselves against a common and deleterious parasite (Gyrodactylus turnbulli). Adult male guppies underwent 31 days of artificial demasculinization with the androgen receptor-antagonist flutamide, or feminization with a combination of flutamide and the synthetic oestrogen 17 β-estradiol, and their parasite loads were compared over time to untreated males and females. Both demasculinized and feminized male guppies had lower G. turnbulli loads than the untreated males and females, but this effect appeared to be mainly the result of demasculinization, with feminization having no additional measurable effect. Furthermore, demasculinized males, feminized males and untreated females all suffered lower Gyrodactylus-induced mortality than untreated males. Together, these results suggest that androgens reduce the ability of guppies to control parasite loads, and modulate resistance to and survival from infection. We discuss the relevance of these findings for understanding constraints on the evolution of resistance in guppies and other vertebrates."

Reduction in average body size has been suggested as one of the universal responses to global warming in aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, however, coincides with human-enhanced dispersal of alien species and can facilitate their establishment. We address effects of species introductions on the size structure of recipient communities using data on Red Sea bivalves entering the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal. We show that the invasion leads to increase in median body size of the Mediterranean assemblage. Alien species are significantly larger than native Mediterranean bivalves, even though they represent a random subset of the Red Sea species with respect to body size. The observed patterns result primarily from the differences in the taxonomic composition and body-size distributions of the source and recipient species pools. In contrast to the expectations based on the general temperature–size relationships in marine ectotherms, continued warming of the Mediterranean Sea indirectly leads to an increase in the proportion of large-bodied species in bivalve assemblages by accelerating the entry and spread of tropical aliens. These results underscore complex interactions between changing climate and species invasions in driving functional shifts in marine ecosystems."

10.5061/dryad.s1v3801,open,Data from: Local interactions and self-organized spatial patterns stabilize microbial cross-feeding against cheaters,"Mutualisms are ubiquitous, but models predict they should be susceptible to cheating.  Resolving this paradox has become relevant to synthetic ecology: cooperative cross-feeding, a nutrient exchange mutualism, has been proposed to stabilize microbial consortia.  Previous attempts to understand how cross-feeders remain robust to non-producing cheaters have relied on complex behavior (e.g., cheater punishment) or group selection.  Using a stochastic spatial model, we demonstrate two novel mechanisms that can allow cross-feeders to outcompete cheaters, rather than just escape from them.  Both mechanisms work through the spatial segregation of the resources, which prevents individual cheaters from acquiring the resources they need to reproduce.  First, if microbe dispersal is low but resources are shared widely, then the cross-feeders self-organize into stable spatial patterns.  Here the cross-feeders can build up where the resource they need is abundant, and send their resource to where their partner is, separating resources at regular intervals in space.  Second, if dispersal is high but resource sharing is local, then random variation in population density creates small-scale variation in resource density, separating the resources from each other by chance.  These results suggest that cross-feeding may be more robust than previously expected and offer strategies to engineer stable consortia."

We study an oscillatory biological system: collective activity cycles in ant colonies. Ant colonies have become model systems for research on biological networks because the interactions between the component parts are visible to the naked eye, and because the time-ordered contact network formed by these interactions serves as the substrate for the distribution of information and other resources throughout the colony. To understand how the collective activity cycles influence the contact network transport properties, we used an automated tracking system to record the movement of all the individuals within nine different ant colonies. From these trajectories we extracted over two million ant-to-ant interactions. Time-series analysis of the temporal fluctuations of the overall colony interaction and movement rates revealed that both the period and amplitude of the activity cycles exhibit a diurnal cycle, in which daytime cycles are faster and of greater amplitude than night cycles. Using epidemiology-derived models of transmission over networks, we compared the transmission properties of the observed periodic contact networks with those of synthetic aperiodic networks. These simulations revealed that contrary to some predictions, regularly-oscillating contact networks should impede information transmission. Further, we provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect, and present evidence in support of it."

These unprecedented mechanical properties are achieved through an intricate interplay between the structure and locally varying the composition of these natural tissues. This level of control cannot be achieved in soft synthetic materials. To address this shortcoming, a novel 3D printing approach to fabricate strong and tough soft materials is introduced, namely double network granular hydrogels (DNGHs) made from compartmentalized reagents. This is achieved with an ink composed of microgels that are swollen in a monomer-containing solution; after the ink is additive manufactured, these monomers are converted into a percolating network, resulting in a DNGH. These DNGHs are sufficiently stiff to repetitively support tensile loads up to 1.3&nbsp;MPa. Moreover, they are more than an order of magnitude tougher than each of the pure polymeric networks they are made from. It is demonstrated that this ink enables printing macroscopic, strong, and tough objects, which can optionally be rendered responsive, with high shape fidelity. The modular and robust fabrication of DNGHs opens up new possibilities to design adaptive, strong, and tough hydrogels that have the potential to advance, for example, soft robotic applications.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.34kh1,open,Data from: Wood ants produce a potent antimicrobial agent by applying formic acid on tree-collected resin,"Wood ants fight pathogens by incorporating tree resin with antimicrobial properties into their nests. They also produce large quantities of formic acid in their venom gland, which they readily spray to defend or disinfect their nest. Mixing chemicals to produce powerful antibiotics is common practice in human medicine, yet evidence for the use of such ""defensive cocktails"" by animals remains scant. Here, we test the hypothesis that wood ants enhance the antifungal activity of tree resin by treating it with formic acid. In a series of experiments, we document that (i) tree resin had much higher inhibitory activity against the common entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum after having been in contact with ants, while no such effect was detected for other nest materials; (ii) wood ants applied significant amounts of endogenous formic and succinic acid on resin and other nest materials; and (iii) the application of synthetic formic acid greatly increased the antifungal activity of resin, but had no such effect when applied to inert glass material. Together, these results demonstrate that wood ants obtain an effective protection against a detrimental microorganism by mixing endogenous and plant-acquired chemical defenses. In conclusion, the ability to synergistically combine antimicrobial substances of diverse origins is not restricted to humans and may play an important role in insect societies."

There is thus much interest in understanding its underlying materiome. While expression of the different silk proteins (spidroins) appears an integral component of silk performance, our understanding of the nature of the relationship between the spidroins, their constituent amino acids, and MA silk mechanics is ambiguous. To provide clarity on these relationships across spider species we performed a meta-analysis utilizing phylogenetic comparative methods. These showed that glycine and proline, both of which are indicators of differential spidroin expression, had effects on MA silk mechanics across the phylogeny. We also found serine to correlate with silk mechanics, probably via its presence within the carboxyl and amino terminal domains of the spidroins.  From our analyses we concluded that spidroin expression shifts across the phylogeny from predominantly MaSp1 in the MA silks of ancestral spiders to predominantly MaSp2 in the more derived spider's silks. This trend was accompanied by an enhanced ultimate strain and decreased Young's modulus in the silks. Our meta-analysis enabled us to decipher between real and apparent influences on MA silk properties, providing significant insights into spider silk and web co-evolution and enhancing our capacity to create spider silk-like materials.</p>"

<p>Abstract:<br>
Multi-species microbial communities are widespread in natural ecosystems. When employed for biomanufacturing, engineered synthetic communities have shown increased productivity in comparison with monocultures and allow for the reduction of metabolic load by compartmentalising bioprocesses between multiple sub-populations. Despite these benefits, co-cultures are rarely used in practice because control over the constituent species of an assembled community has proven challenging. Here we demonstrate, in silico, the efficacy of an approach from artificial intelligence &ndash; reinforcement learning &ndash; for the control of co-cultures within continuous bioreactors. We confirm that feedback via reinforcement learning can be used to maintain populations at target levels, and that model-free performance with bang-bang control can outperform a traditional proportional integral controller with continuous control, when faced with infrequent sampling. Further, we demonstrate that a satisfactory control policy can be learned in one twenty-four hour experiment by running five bioreactors in parallel. Finally, we show that reinforcement learning can directly optimise the output of a co-culture bioprocess. Overall, reinforcement learning is a promising technique for the control of microbial communities.</p>"

It is of great significance to develop energy-efficient routines that can synthesize zeolites Na-A and Na-X from low-cost raw materials. Coal fly ash (CFA) is the major residue from the combustion of coal and biomass containing more than 85% SiO2 and Al2O3, which can readily replace the conventionally used sodium silicate and aluminate for zeolite synthesis. We used Na2CO3 to replace the expensive NaOH used for the calcination of CFA and showed that tablet compression can enhance the contact with Na2CO3 for the activation of CFA through calcination for the synthesis of zeolites Na-A and Na-X under mild conditions. We optimized the control variables for zeolite synthesis and showed that phase-pure zeolite Na-A can be synthesized with CFA at reactant molar ratio, hydrothermal reaction temperature and reaction time of 1.3Na2O: 0.6Al2O3: 1SiO2: 38H2O at 80°C for 6 h, respectively, while phase-pure zeolite Na-X can be synthesized at 2.2Na2O: 0.2Al2O3: 1SiO2: 88H2O at 100°C for 8 h, respectively.

Because direct effects of rearrangements on fertility imply fitness costs during their spread, understanding the mechanism of F1 hybrid sterility is integral to reconstructing the role(s) of rearrangements in speciation. In hybrids between monkeyflowers Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii, rearrangements contain all quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for both premating barriers and pollen sterility, suggesting that they may have facilitated speciation in this model system. We used artificial chromosome doubling and comparative mapping to test whether heterozygous rearrangements directly cause underdominant male sterility in M. lewisii-M. cardinalis hybrids. Consistent with a direct chromosomal basis for hybrid sterility, synthetic tetraploid F1s showed highly restored fertility (83.4% pollen fertility) relative to diploids F1s (36.0%). Additional mapping with M. parishii-M. cardinalis and M. parishii-M. lewisii hybrids demonstrated that underdominant male sterility is caused by one M. lewisii-specific and one M. cardinalis-specific reciprocal translocation, but that inversions had no direct effects on fertility. We discuss the importance of translocations as causes of reproductive isolation, and consider models for how underdominant rearrangements spread and fix despite intrinsic fitness costs."

A major problem for water-dwelling organisms is chemical pollution, and among the most common pollutants is 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), the synthetic estrogen that is used in oral contraceptives and that can affect fish at various developmental stages, including embryogenesis. We tested whether there is variation in the tolerance to EE2 within Alpine whitefish. We sampled spawners from two species of different lakes, bred them in vitro in a full-factorial design each, and studied growth and mortality of embryos. Exposure to EE2 turned out to be toxic in all concentrations we tested (≥1 ng/L). It reduced embryo viability and slowed down embryogenesis. We found significant additive genetic variation in EE2-induced mortality in both species, that is, genotypes differed in their tolerance to estrogen pollution. We also found maternal effects on embryo development to be influenced by EE2, that is, some maternal sib groups were more susceptible to EE2 than others. In conclusion, the toxic effects of EE2 were strong, but both species demonstrated the kind of additive genetic variation that is necessary for an evolutionary response to this type of pollution."

This analysis pipeline will be initially tested on a synthetic dataset created ad-hoc to identify its accuracy in identifying the most relevant portion of the signals. Successively this method will be applied to simulations describing the behaviors of populations of cancer cells treated with either one or two drugs in different concentrations.
The proposed method will be shown to be effective in identifying which changes in the treatment protocol leads to a more extensive response to treatment.

10.5061/dryad.13n29,open,Data from: Pollinator specificity drives strong prepollination reproductive isolation in sympatric sexually deceptive orchids,"Few studies have quantified the full range of pre– and postzygotic barriers that limit introgression between closely related plant species. Here we assess the strength of four isolating mechanisms operating between two morphologically similar and very closely related sympatric orchid taxa, Chiloglottis valida and C. aff. jeanesii. Each taxon sexually attracts its specific wasp pollinator via distinct floral volatile chemistry. Behavioral experiments with flowers and synthetic versions of their floral volatiles confirmed that very strong pollinator isolation is mediated by floral odor chemistry. However, artificially placing flowers of the two taxa in contact proximity revealed the potential for rare interspecific pollination. Although we found hybrid vigour in F1 hybrids produced by hand-crossing , genetic analysis at both nuclear and chloroplast loci showed significant and moderate to strong genetic differentiation between taxa. A Bayesian clustering method for the detection of introgression at nuclear loci failed to find any evidence for hybridization across 571 unique genotypes at one site of sympatry. Rather than inhibiting gene flow, postpollination barriers surveyed here show no contribution to overall reproductive isolation. This demonstrates the primacy of pollinators in maintaining species boundaries in these orchids, which display one of the strongest known examples of prepollination floral isolation."

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Silk producing arthropods spin solid fibres from an aqueous protein feedstock apparently relying on the complex structure of the silk protein and its controlled aggregation by shear forces, alongside biochemical changes. This flow-induced phase-transition of the stored native silk molecules is irreversible, environmentally sound and remarkably energy efficient. The process seemingly relies on a self-assembling, fibrillation process. Here we test this hypothesis by biomimetically spinning a native-based silk feedstock, extracted by custom processes, into silk fibres that equal their natural models&rsquo; mechanical properties. Importantly, these filaments, which featured cross-section morphologies ranged from large crescent-like to small ribbon-like shapes, also had the slender cross-sectional areas of native fibres and their hierarchical nanofibrillar structures. The modulation of the post-draw conditions directly affected mechanical properties, correlated with extent of fibre crystallinity, i.e. degree of molecular order. We believe our study contributes significantly to the understanding and development of artificial silks by demonstrating successful biomimetic spinning relies on appropriately designed feedstock properties. In addition, our study provides inspiration for low-energy routes to synthetic polymers.</p>

10.5061/dryad.16qk7vf,open,Data from: Female assortative mate choice functionally validates synthesized male odors of evolving river-lake stickleback ecotypes,"During mate choice decisions, females of many vertebrates use male olfactory cues to achieve immunogenetic optimality of their offspring. Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) populating habitats that differ in their parasite communities evolve locally adapted combinations of genetic variants encoded at the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Such adaptation confers optimal resistance to the local parasite fauna. Immunogenetic signatures co-evolved with local parasites favor population-specific assortative mate choice behaviour. Previous studies have shown that female sticklebacks evaluate male MHC-associated olfactory cues during the process of mate choice, but how habitat-specific information is exchanged between males and females has remained elusive. Here, we directly demonstrate the molecular nature of the olfactory cue providing habitat-specific information. Under controlled laboratory conditions females that are ready to mate prefer mixtures of synthetic MHC peptide ligands mimicking the optimal allele number of their original population. These results imply that female sticklebacks can determine the number of MHC alleles of their prospective mates, compare it to their own immunogenetic status, and, if optimal with respect to the immunogenetic complementarity, accept the male as mate. Our results suggest a potentially common mechanism of ecological speciation in vertebrates that is based on the olfactory assessment of habitat-specific immunogenetic diversity."

Their synthetic imitation, known as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), have found applications in a variety of (nano)medicinal fields such as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, multimodal imaging and drug carriers. In order to perform these functions in medicine, shape and size control of the SPIONs is vital. We sampled SPIONs at ten-minutes intervals during the high-temperature thermal decomposition reaction. Their shape (sphericity and anisotropy) and geometric description (volume and surface area) were retrieved using three-dimensional imaging techniques, which allowed to reconstruct each particle in three dimensions, followed by stereological quantification methods. The results, supported by small angle X-ray scattering characterization, reveal that SPIONs initially have a spherical shape, then grow increasingly asymmetric and irregular. A high heterogeneity in volume at the initial stages makes place for lower particle volume dispersity at later stages. The SPIONs settled into a preferred orientation on the support used for transmission electron microscopy imaging, which hides the extent of their anisotropic nature in the axial dimension, there by biasing the interpretation of standard 2D micrographs. This information could be feedback into the design of the chemical processes and the characterization strategies to improve the current applications of SPIONs in nanomedicine.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.vg7sr,open,Data from: Multidimensional (co)evolutionary stability,"The complexity of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions is such that the fitness of individuals is likely to depend on multiple traits. Using a synthetic framework of phenotypic evolution that draws from adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics approaches, we explore how the number of traits under selection influences convergence stability and evolutionary stability in models for coevolution in multidimensional phenotype spaces. Our results allow us to identify three different effects of trait dimensionality on stability. First are (i) a ""combinatorial effect"": without epistasis and genetic correlations, a higher number of trait dimensions offers more opportunities for equilibria to be unstable; and (ii) epistatic interactions, that is, fitness interactions between traits, which tend to destabilize evolutionary equilibria; this effect increases with the dimension of phenotype space. These first two effects influence both convergence stability and evolutionary stability, while (iii) genetic correlations (due, e.g., to pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium) can affect only convergence stability. We illustrate the general prediction that increased dimensionality destabilizes evolutionary equilibria using examples drawn from well-studied classical models of frequency-dependent competition for resources, adaptation to a spatially heterogeneous environment, and antagonistic coevolution. In addition, our analyses show that increased dimensionality can favor diversification, for example, in the form of local adaptation, as well as evolutionary escape."
10.5061/dryad.r7sqv9sc3,open,Males perceive honest information from female released sex pheromone in a moth,"<p>There is accumulating evidence that male insects advertise their quality to conspecific females through pheromones. However, most studies of female released sex pheromone assume information transfer regarding merely the species of the female and her mating status. We show that more and precise information is conveyed through the female sex pheromone, positioning it as an honest sexual trait. We demonstrate that females in bad physical conditions (small, starved or old) lay significantly fewer eggs than females in good conditions (large, fed or young). The ratio of the sex pheromone blend in gland extracts of female pink bollworm moths accurately describes the female phenotypic condition whereas the pheromone amount in the glands fails to provide an honest signal of quality. Moreover, males use the female released pheromone blend to choose their mates and approach females that signal higher reproductive potential. In addition, surrogating the female effect, using synthetic pheromone blend that represents that of higher quality females (0.6:0.4 ZZ:ZE) more males were attracted to this blend than to the blend representing the population mean (0.5:0.5 ZZ:ZE). Both, female advertisement for males and the male choosiness, suggest that pheromones have evolved as sexual traits under directional, sexual selection.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.q44p3,open,Data from: Combined use of molecular markers and high resolution melting (HRM) to assess chromosome dosage in potato hybrids,"In plants, the most widely used cytological techniques to assess parental genome contributions are based on in situ hybridization (FISH and GISH), but they are time-consuming and need specific expertise and equipment. Recent advances in genomics and molecular biology have made PCR-based markers a straightforward, affordable technique for chromosome typing. Here, we describe the development of a molecular assay that uses single-copy conserved ortholog set II (COSII)-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the high-resolution melting (HRM) technique to assess the chromosome dosage of interspecific hybrids between a Solanum phureja–S. tuberosum diploid (2n = 2x = 24) hybrid and its wild relative S. commersonii. Screening and analysis of 45 COSII marker sequences allowed S. commersonii-specific SNPs to be identified for all 12 chromosomes. Combining the HRM technique with the establishment of synthetic DNA hybrids, SNP markers were successfully used to predict the expected parental chromosome ratio of 5 interspecific triploid hybrids. These results demonstrate the ability of this strategy to distinguish diverged genomes from each other, and to estimate chromosome dosage. The method could potentially be applied to any species as a tool to assess paternal to maternal ratios in the framework of a breeding program or following transformation techniques."
10.5061/dryad.q2bvq83g1,open,Data from: Contrasting patterns of functional diversity in coffee root fungal communities associated with organic and conventionally-managed fields,"<p>The structure and function of fungal communities in the coffee rhizosphere is shaped by crop environment. Because coffee can be grown along a management continuum from conventional application of pesticides and fertilizers in full sun to organic management in a shaded understory, we used coffee fields to hold host constant while comparing rhizosphere fungal communities in markedly different environmental conditions with regard to shade and inputs. We characterized the shade and soil environment in 25 fields under conventional, organic or transitional management in two regions of Costa Rica. We amplified the ITS2 region of fungal DNA from coffee roots in these fields and characterized the rhizosphere fungal community via high-throughput sequencing. Sequences were assigned to guilds to determine differences in functional diversity and trophic structure among coffee field environments. Organic fields had more shade, a greater richness of shade tree species, more leaf litter, and were less acidic, with lower soil nitrate availability and higher soil copper, calcium, and magnesium than conventionally-managed fields, although differences between organic and conventionally-managed fields in shade, calcium and magnesium depended on region. Differences in richness and community composition of rhizosphere fungi between organic and conventionally-managed fields were also correlated with shade, soil acidity, nitrate, and copper. Trophic structure differed with coffee field management. Saprotrophs, plant pathogens, and mycoparasites were more diverse and plant pathogens were more abundant in organic than in conventionally-managed fields, while saprotroph-plant pathogens were more abundant in conventionally-managed fields. These differences reflected environmental differences and depended on region.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANCE</b></p>

<p>Rhizosphere fungi play key roles in ecosystems, as nutrient cyclers, pathogens, and mutualists, yet little is currently known about which environmental factors and how agricultural management shape rhizosphere fungal communities and their functional diversity. This field study of the coffee agroecosystem suggests that organic management not only fosters a greater overall diversity of fungi, but also maintains a greater richness of saprotrophic, plant pathogenic and mycoparasitic fungi that has implications for efficiency of nutrient cycling and regulation of plant pathogen populations in agricultural systems. As well as influencing community composition and richness of rhizosphere fungi, shade management and use of fungicides and synthetic fertilizers altered the trophic structure of the coffee agroecosystem.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.63s8h,open,Data from: Defining the risk landscape in the context of pathogen pollution: Toxoplasma gondii in sea otters along the Pacific Rim,"Pathogens entering the marine environment as pollutants exhibit a spatial signature driven by their transport mechanisms. The sea otter (Enhydra lutris), a marine animal that lives much of its life within sight of land, presents a unique opportunity to understand land-sea pathogen transmission. Using a dataset on Toxoplasma gondii prevalence across sea otter range from Alaska to California, we found that the dominant drivers of infection risk vary depending upon the spatial scale of analysis. At the population level, regions with high T. gondii prevalence had higher human population density and a greater proportion of human-dominated land uses suggesting a strong role for population density of the felid definitive host of this parasite. This relationship persisted when a subset of data were analysed at the individual level: large-scale patterns in sea otter T. gondii infection prevalence were largely explained by individual exposure to areas of high human housing unit density, and other landscape features associated with anthropogenic land use, such as impervious surfaces and cropping land. These results contrast with the small-scale, within-region analysis, in which age, sex and prey choice accounted for most of the variation in infection risk, and terrestrial environmental features provided little variation to help in explaining observed patterns. These results underscore the importance of spatial scale in study design when quantifying both individual-level risk factors and landscape-scale variation in infection risk."

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>The data set contains the updated test reference years (TRY) of the German Weather Service (DWD). By subdividing into 15 TRY regions, each postcode area can be assigned a representative weather data set. It should be emphasized that in addition to a mean, current test reference year for a region, there is also a year with extreme summer and extreme winter weather. To take climate change into account, there is then a time series for the year 2045 for each test reference year based on the IPCC climate models. This means that a total of 90 weather data sets are available with a one-hour time resolution.</p>

<p>In order to use the data in simulations with a temporal resolution of 1min or 15min, the data set was extended by linear interpolation. While this approach is justifiable for air pressure and temperature, for example, it does not depict high fluctuations in solar radiation. Therefore, based on the one-minute open data measurement data set of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network, with an algorithm by Hofmann et. al. the time series of global radiation are newly generated for all test reference years. Another algorithm by Hofmann et. al. was used to calculate the corresponding diffuse radiation times series.</p>

We provide the used plankton and synthetic datasets with the following explanations summarized from the above-mentioned paper. The technical descriptions are given below.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Plankton Dataset</strong><br>
<br>
The plankton dataset contains diverse grey-level images of marine planktonic organisms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The images were captured with an Underwater Vision Profiler 5 and are hosted on EcoTaxa (<a href=""https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/"">https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/</a>). In the citizen science project PlanktonID (<a href=""https://planktonid.geomar.de/en"">https://planktonid.geomar.de/en</a>), each sample was classified multiple times by citizen scientists. We used the data generated by version two of PlanktonID.&nbsp; This version is only available to users which have done at least 1000 annotations in version one. Therefore, we can assume that the annotators know the differences between the classes and are dedicated to creating consistent results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second version of PlanktonID is a game where example images can be sorted into three proposed classes.&nbsp; If none of the proposed classes seem to fit, the user has the option to select any other of the 28 classes (<a href=""https://planktonid.geomar.de/en/classes"">https://planktonid.geomar.de/en/classes</a>) of PlanktonID (including a &#39;no fitting category&#39; class). The initial proposals are generated by a neural network, hence, a confirmation bias might be introduced. Some classes of the PlanktonID dataset have very few examples in comparison to others (e.g. three single images).<br>
The dataset consists of 12,280 images in originally 28 classes. We picked the largest classes and merged some smaller classes (e.g. different classes of detritus). All other images are assigned to the class &#39;no fitting category&#39;. We used 400 training&nbsp; and 200 validation images per class. We selected these images from the available data where all annotators agreed on the label. All other images are used as unlabeled data. If not enough images for training and validation were available, we used random duplicates.<br>
For more details please see the main paper ( <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196661"">https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196661</a>).<br>
<br>
<strong>Synthetic Datasets</strong><br>
<br>
This dataset is a mixture of circles and ellipses (bubbles) on a black background with different colors. The 6 ground-truth classes are blue, red and green circles or ellipses. An image is defined as certain if the hue of the color is 0 (red), 120 (green) or 240 (blue) and the main axis ratio of the bubble is 1 (circle) or 2 (ellipse). Every other datapoint is considered fuzzy and the ground-truth label is the interpolation of the 6 ground-truth classes. The dataset consists of 1800 certain and 1000 fuzzy labeled images for train, validation and unlabeled data split.<br>
We defined three subsets: Ideal, Real, Fuzzy. The Ideal subset uses the majority ground-truth label for every image which is in Reality not available. For the Real subset, the ground-truth classes in randomly picked from the ground-truth label distribution and represent&nbsp; an noisy / fuzzy annotation. The Fuzzy subset only uses certain labeled images as training data and represent a cleaned training dataset.<br>
For more details please see the main paper ( <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196661"">https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196661</a>).<br>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Native mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the stoichiometry and ion occupancy of recombinant human calmodulin (CaM) and recombinant rat caldendrin (CaD) complex with synthetic mouse myosinV IQ1 (myoIQ) motif in the presence / absence of excess Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions.</p>

<p><strong>Sample processing:</strong></p>

<p>Full-length CaD and CaM as well as the synthetic myoVa peptide were buffer exchanged into 150 mM aqueous ammonium acetate solution (pH&nbsp;7.4). CaM was twice passed through a Bio-Spin P-6 gel filtration spin column (6 kDa cut-off, <em>Bio-Rad</em>), CaD and the myoVa peptide were buffer exchanged through five cycles of tenfold dilution and re-concentration using centrifugal concentrators Vivaspin 500 (10 kDa cut-off, <em>Sartorius</em>) or Amicon Ultra 0.5mL (3 kDa cut-off, <em>Merck/Millipore</em>), respectively. Desalted proteins were introduced into an Orbitrap Q Exactive UHMR mass spectrometer (<em>Thermo Scientific</em>) via static nanoelectrospray ionization from in-house prepared gold-coated borosilicate glass capillaries Kwik-Fil 1B120F-4 (<em>World Precision Instruments</em>). Proteins were sprayed and analysed at 8.5 &micro;M concentration in ammonium acetate alone or supplemented with 200 &micro;M calcium acetate and 100 &micro;M magnesium acetate (both for trace metal analysis, <em>Sigma-Aldrich</em>). For interaction analysis, CaM and/or caldendrin were mixed with myoVa peptide which had final concentration of 8.5 &micro;M (low concentration) or 34 &micro;M (high concentration). The mass spectrometer was tuned for best signal quality and intensity, keeping ion activation and unfolding minimal. Namely, electrospray voltage was kept at 1.3 kV, source desolvation temperature 250&deg;C, in-source desolvation -50 V, ion transfer profile &ldquo;high m/z&rdquo;, analyzer profile &ldquo;low m/z&rdquo;, analyzer target resolution 12500 acquiring in mass range 500 &ndash; 9000 m/z. Nitrogen was used as collision gas in HCD cell at relative gas pressure setting 7.0 with gentle collisional activation by 10 V HCD voltage gradient.</p>

<p><strong>Data processing:</strong></p>

<p>Raw spectra were averaged over at least 50 scans for mass deconvolution and peak assignment in UniDec 4.4.1 package (<em>Marty et al, 2015</em>). The averaged spectra were exported for ZENODO deposition using <em>Thermo Scientific</em> FreeStyle 1.5.93.34 as single-scan Thermo .raw files (including instrumental parameters metadata) as well as in plain m/z vs intensity .txt files.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.6tg35t6,open,Data from: Selection signatures underlying dramatic male inflorescence transformation during modern hybrid maize breeding,"Inflorescence capacity plays a crucial role in reproductive fitness in plants, and in production of hybrid crops. Maize is a monoecious species bearing separate male and female flowers (tassel and ear, respectively). The switch from open-pollinated populations of maize to hybrid-based breeding schemes in the early 20th century was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in tassel size, and the trend has continued with modern breeding over the recent decades. The goal of this study was to identify selection signatures in genes that may underlie this dramatic transformation. Using a population of 942 diverse inbred maize accessions and a nested association mapping population comprised of three 200-line biparental populations, we measured 15 tassel morphological characteristics by manual and image-based methods. Genome-wide association studies identified 242 single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with measured traits. We compared 41 unselected lines from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) population to 21 highly selected lines developed by modern commercial breeding programs and show that tassel size and weight were reduced significantly. We assayed genetic differences between the two groups using selection statistics XP-EHH, XP-CLR, and FST. All three selection statistics show evidence of selection at genomic regions associated with tassel morphology relative to genome-wide null distributions. These results support the tremendous effect, both phenotypic and genotypic, that selection has had on maize male inflorescence morphology."

<p>Thin sections were made from 11 macroscopically undeformed granite samples from the Tso Morari complex. Samples 11-01, 11-02, L08-04 and a05-10 were selected for detailed petrological analysis. Major element compositions of minerals that exhibit solid solutions were measured using a Cameca SX-5 field emission electron microprobe (EMPA) at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford. All EMPA analyses were conducted with 15 keV acceleration potential, 20 nA beam current. For all major elements, the on-peak count time was 30 seconds with 30 seconds background count. Ti was measured with a 60 seconds on-peak count time and 60 seconds background collection. A range of natural and synthetic oxide standards were used including albite (Na, Al, Si), MgO (Mg), wollastonite (Ca), andradite (Fe), Mn (Mn) and TiO<sub>2</sub> (Ti) and analyses were verified against secondary mineral standards. Raw analyses were automatically corrected for atomic number, absorption and fluorescence using the <em>phi-rho-z</em> matrix correction routine (Merlet, 1994). Mineral spot analyses and line profiles were taken across white mica and garnet to determine the extent of intracrystalline compositional variation.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.74940,open,Data from: Reproductive activity triggers accelerated male mortality and decreases lifespan: genetic and gene expression determinants in Drosophila,"Reproduction and aging evolved to be intimately associated. Experimental selection for early-life reproduction drives the evolution of decreased longevity in Drosophila whereas experimental selection for increased longevity leads to changes in reproduction. Although life history theory offers hypotheses to explain these relationships, the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms underlying reproduction–longevity associations remain a matter of debate. Here we show that mating triggers accelerated mortality in males and identify hundreds of genes that are modulated upon mating in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Interrogation of genome-wide gene expression in virgin and recently mated males revealed coherent responses, with biological processes that are upregulated (testis-specific gene expression) or downregulated (metabolism and mitochondria-related functions) upon mating. Furthermore, using a panel of genotypes from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) as a source of naturally occurring genetic perturbation, we uncover abundant variation in longevity and reproduction-induced mortality among genotypes. Genotypes displayed more than fourfold variation in longevity and reproduction-induced mortality that can be traced to variation in specific segments of the genome. The data reveal individual variation in sensitivity to reproduction and physiological processes that are enhanced and suppressed upon mating. These results raise the prospect that variation in longevity and age-related traits could be traced to processes that coordinate germline and somatic function."
10.5061/dryad.908jf3r,open,Data from: Functional divergence of the bitter receptor TAS2R38 in Sulawesi macaques,"Bitter perception is mediated by G protein-coupled receptors TAS2Rs and plays an important role in avoiding the ingestion of toxins by inducing innate avoidance behavior in mammals. One of the best-studied TAS2Rs is TAS2R38, which mediates the perception of the bitterness of synthetic phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). Previous studies of TAS2R38 have suggested that geographical separation enabled the independent divergence of bitter taste perception. The functional divergence of TAS2R38 in allopatric species has not been evaluated. We characterized the function of TAS2R38 in four allopatric species of Sulawesi macaques on Sulawesi Island. We found variation in PTC taste perception both within and across species. In most cases, TAS2R38 was sensitive to PTC, with functional divergence among species. We observed different truncated TAS2R38s that were not responsive to PTC in each species of Macaca nigra and M. nigrescens due to premature stop codons. Some variants of intact TAS2R38 with an amino acid substitution showed low sensitivity to PTC in M. tonkeana. Similarly, this intact TAS2R38 with PTC-low sensitivity has also been found in humans. We detected a shared haplotype in all four Sulawesi macaques, which may be the ancestral haplotype of Sulawesi macaques. In addition to shared haplotypes among Sulawesi macaques, other TAS2R38 haplotypes were species-specific. These results implied that the variation in TAS2R38 might be shaped by geographical patterns and local adaptation."
10.5061/dryad.1mt16,open,Data from: Methods for invasive species control are transferable across invaded areas,"Cane Toads (Rhinella marina) are invasive pests in many parts of the world, including the Japanese island of Ishigaki. Extensive research in Australia has identified promising new methods for control, but also has shown that toads exhibit geographic variation in many traits (suggesting that methods developed in one location may not work in another). Can the approaches developed in Australia play a useful role for controlling this invasive species in Japan? Our experimental trials on Ishigaki Island suggest that these new methods can be successfully applied to Japan. First, Cane Toad embryos exposed to chemical cues of conspecific tadpoles exhibited a reduction in viability (subsequent growth and development). This response appears to be species-specific, with native frog embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from toad tadpoles, and Cane Toad embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from native frog tadpoles. Second, Cane Toad tadpoles were attracted to traps containing water from conspecific eggs, and toxin from adult conspecifics. Third, adult Cane Toads were attracted to acoustic cues of calling males, with sex differences in rates of attraction to specific versions of a synthetic call (males were attracted to choruses whereas females were attracted to low-frequency calls). Our results suggest that the methods developed by Australian researchers are applicable to controlling invasive Cane Toads in Japan."

However, the impacts of microplastics, consisting of a large variety of synthetic polymers, on freshwater organisms remains poorly understood. We examined the effects of two polymer mixtures on the morphology, life history and on the molecular level of the waterflea Daphnia magna (three different clones). Microplastic particles of ~40 µm were supplied at a low concentration (1% of the food particles) leading to an average of ~30 particles in the digestive tract which reflects a high microplastic contamination but still resembles a natural situation. Neither increased mortality nor changes on the morphological (body length, width and tail spine length) or reproductive parameters were observed for adult Daphnia. The analyses of juvenile Daphnia revealed a variety of small and rather subtle responses of morphological traits (body length, width and tail spine length). For adult Daphnia, alterations in expression of genes related to stress responses (i.e. HSP60, HSP70 &amp; GST) as well as of other genes involved in body function and body composition  (i.e. SERCA) were observed already 48h after exposure. We anticipate that the adverse effects of microplastic might be influenced by many additional factors like size, shape, type and even age of the particles and that the rather weak effects, as detected in a laboratory, may lead to reduced fitness in a natural multi-stressor environment."

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Here, we report that 1,4-dioxane potentiates the capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPV1, thereby causing hyperalgesia in mouse model. This effect was abolished by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion of TRPV1 in sensory neurons, but enhanced under inflammatory conditions. 1,4-Dioxane lowered the temperature threshold for TRPV1 thermal activation and potentiated the channel sensitivity to agonistic stimuli. 1,3-dioxane and tetrahydrofuran which are structurally related to 1,4-dioxane also potentiated TRPV1 activation. The residue M572 in the S4-S5 linker region of TRPV1 was found to be crucial for direct activation of the channel by 1,4-dioxane and its analogues. A single residue mutation M572V abrogated the 1,4-dioxane-evoked currents while largely preserving the capsaicin responses. Our results further demonstrate that this residue exerts a gating effect through hydrophobic interactions and support the existence of discrete domains for multimodal gating of TRPV1 channel.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Our results suggest TRPV1 is a co-receptor for 1,4-dioxane, and that this accounts for its ability to dysregulate body nociceptive sensation.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.qp747,open,Data from: Inferring heterogeneous evolutionary processes through time: from sequence substitution to phylogeography,"Molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic reconstructions generally assume time-homogeneous substitution processes. Motivated by computational convenience, this assumption sacrifices biological realism and offers little opportunity to uncover the temporal dynamics in evolutionary histories. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that explicitly relaxes the time-homogeneity assumption by allowing the specification of different infinitesimal substitution rate matrices across different time intervals, called epochs, along the evolutionary history. We focus on an epoch model implementation in a Bayesian inference framework that offers great modeling flexibility in drawing inference about any discrete data type characterized as a continuous-time Markov chain, including phylogeographic traits. To alleviate the computational burden that the additional temporal heterogeneity imposes, we adopt a massively parallel approach that achieves both fine- and coarse-grain parallelization of the computations across branches that accommodate epoch transitions, making extensive use of graphics processing units. Through synthetic examples, we assess model performance in recovering evolutionary parameters from data generated according to different evolutionary scenarios that comprise different numbers of epochs for both nucleotide and codon substitution processes. We illustrate the usefulness of our inference framework in two different applications to empirical data sets: the selection dynamics on within-host HIV populations throughout infection and the seasonality of global influenza circulation. In both cases, our epoch model captures key features of temporal heterogeneity that remained difficult to test using ad hoc procedures."

For birds with innate songs, such as the suboscine passerine birds, the integration and comparison of both genetic and ecological factors in explaining song variation at the microevolutionary scale is rare. Here we evaluated the evolutionary and ecological processes underlying the variation in the songs of the Atlantic Forest endemic Drab-breasted Bamboo Tyrant (<i>Hemitriccus diops</i>), testing the effects of both stochastic and adaptive processes, namely the Stochastic and Adaptation Acoustic Hypotheses, respectively. We combined vocal, genetic and ecological (climate and forest cover) data across the species' range. To this end, we analyzed 89 samples of long and short songs. We performed analyses on raw and synthetic data song variables with linear mixed models and multivariate statistics. Our results show that both song types differ in spectral features between the two extant phylogeographic lineages of this species, but such vocal divergence is weak and subtle in both song types. Overall, there is a positive relationship of acoustic distances with the amount of forest cover in long songs. Our results suggest that there is cryptic geographical variation in both song types and that this variation is associated with low levels of genetic divergence in both songs and with ecological factors in long songs.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.80cv0,open,Data from: Quantifying team cooperation through intrinsic multi-scale measures: respiratory and cardiac synchronisation in choir singers and surgical teams,"A highly localised data-association measure, termed intrinsic synchrosqueezing transform (ISC), is proposed for the analysis of coupled nonlinear and nonstationary multivariate signals. This is achieved based on a combination of noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-based univariate and multivariate synchrosqueezing transforms (FSST and F-MSST). It is shown that the ISC outperforms six other combinations of algorithms in estimating degrees of synchrony in synthetic linear and nonlinear bivariate signals. Its advantage is further illustrated in the precise identification of the synchronised respiratory and HRV frequencies among a subset of bass singers of a professional choir, where it distinctly exhibits better performance than the continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based ISC. We also introduce an extension to intrinsic phase synchrony (IPS) measure, referred to as nested intrinsic phase synchrony (N-IPS), for the empirical quantification of physically meaningful and straightforward to interpret trends in phase synchrony. The N-IPS is employed to reveal physically meaningful variations in the levels of cooperation in choir singing and performing a surgical procedure. Both the proposed techniques successfully reveal degrees of synchronisation of the physiological signals in two different aspects: (i) precise localisation of synchrony in time and frequency (ISC), and (ii) large scale analysis for the empirical quantification of physically meaningful trends in synchrony (N-IPS)."
10.5061/dryad.1h3k8,open,Data from: Long-term agricultural management does not alter the evolution of a soybean-rhizobium mutualism,"Leguminous crops, like soybeans, often rely on biologically fixed nitrogen via their symbiosis with rhizobia rather than synthetic nitrogen inputs. However, agricultural management practices may influence the effectiveness of biological nitrogen fixation. While the ecological effects of agricultural management on rhizobia have received some attention, the evolutionary effects have been neglected in comparison. Resource mutualism theory predicts that evolutionary effects are likely, however. Both fertilization and tillage are predicted to cause the evolution of rhizobia that provide fewer growth benefits to plant hosts and fix less nitrogen. This study capitalized on an LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) experiment that manipulated agricultural management practices in a corn-soybean-wheat row crop system for 24 years to investigate whether four different management practices (conventional, no-till, low chemical input, and certified organic) cause rhizobia populations to evolve to become more or less cooperative. We found little evidence that 24 years of varying management practices affect the net growth benefits rhizobia provide to soybeans, although soybean plants inoculated with soils collected from conventional treatments tended to have lower biological nitrogen fixation rates than plants inoculated with soils from the no-till, low input, and organic management treatments. These findings suggest that rhizobia will continue to provide adequate growth benefits to leguminous crops in the future, even in intensively managed systems."

Machine learning and decision trees offer powerful alternative approaches to this problem but are not widely used in palaeontology. Here, we apply these techniques to published morphometric data of isolated theropod teeth in order to explore their utility in tackling taxonomic problems. We chose two published datasets consisting of 886 teeth from 14 taxa and 3020 teeth from 17 taxa, respectively, each with five morphometric variables per tooth. We also explored the effects that missing data have on the final classification accuracy. Our results suggest that machine learning and decision trees yield superior classification results over a wide range of data permutations, with decision trees achieving accuracies of 96% in classifying test data in some cases. Missing data or attempts to generate synthetic data to overcome missing data seriously degrade all classifiers predictive accuracy. The results of our analyses also indicate that using ensemble classifiers combining different classification techniques and the examination of posterior probabilities is a useful aid in checking final class assignments. The application of such techniques to isolated theropod teeth demonstrate that simple morphometric data can be used to yield statistically robust taxonomic classifications and that lower classification accuracy is more likely to reflect preservational limitations of the data or poor application of the methods."

Pollen fertility of F1 hybrids of inter-archipelago crosses from the Azores, Canaries, and Madeira were generally lower than crosses between populations or species in the same archipelagos. Lower pollen fertility was pronounced in hybrids between plants from the Canaries and the other archipelagos, which is concordant with a more distant phylogenetic relationship between the Canaries, and the Azores and Madeira. Lower average pollen fertility was seen between plants from different as compared to the same clades in the Canary Islands. However, low pollen fertilities were also detected between plants from some populations/species in the same archipelagos, and even among progeny of individual maternal plants. Some hybrids with reduced fertility had meiotic irregularities, suggesting chromosomal rearrangements; in other cases meiosis appeared normal. Results indicate that postzygotic isolating factors evolved subsequent to the divergence of Tolpis in the three archipelagos, but there are hybrid sterility factors among plants within each of the archipelagos, and even within some natural populations. Phylogenetic relationships in the Canary Islands indicate that divergence has occurred within the last million years.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods replace progressively cultivation-based approaches in soil surveys of Oomycetes, but very little control has been done from synthetic communities. Indeed, several potential biases do exist and need to be assessed for Oomycetes communities. We created a mock community by mixing DNA from 24 Phytophthora species. We amplified two barcode regions with Oomycete-specific primers before HTS. With this aim, we used three primer sets in nested PCR amplification, targeting the ITS-1 region or the RAS gene region. The three nested PCR strategies proved to be a reliable qualitative approach, identifying approximately 95% of the species after Illumina Miseq sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. However, quantitative proportions of each species showed distortions compared to the original mixture of the mock. In addition, we compared the two ITS primer sets on soil environmental DNA sampled from temperate forests. The 'oom18S-ITS7/18ph2f-5.8S-1R' primer set, more specific to Phytophthora, was able to detect seven Phytophthora species, confirming what was expected for temperate forests. Using the 'DC6-ITS7/oom18S-ITS7' primer set that covers the broader Peronosporaceans, we detected only one Phytophthora species among the dominance of Pythium and Phytopythium species. We concluded that 'oom18S-ITS7/18ph2f-5.8S-1R' primer set is a reliable tool for the qualitative description of environmental Phytophthora communities."

We developed and validated a pendulum device to measure the impact energetics of microgram-sized trap-jaw ant mandibles accelerated against targets at 10<sup>5</sup> m s<sup>-2</sup>. Trap-jaw ants (<i>Odontomachus brunneus; </i>19 individuals; 212 strikes) were suspended on one pendulum and struck swappable targets that were either attached to an opposing pendulum or fixed in place. Mean post-impact kinetic energy (energy from strike converted to pendulum motion) was higher with a stiff target (21.0-21.5 µJ) than a compliant target (6.4-6.5<b> </b>µJ). Target mobility had relatively little influence. Mean contact duration of strikes against stiff targets was shorter (3.9-4.5 ms) than against compliant targets (6.2-7.9 ms). Shorter contact duration was correlated with higher post-impact kinetic energy. These findings contextualize and provide an energetic explanation for the diverse, natural uses of trap-jaw ant strikes such as impaling prey, launching away threats, and performing mandible-powered jumps. The strong effect of target material on energetic exchange suggests material interactions as an avenue for tuning performance of small, high acceleration impacts. Our device offers a foundation for novel research into the ecomechanics and evolution of tiny biological impacts and their application in synthetic systems.</p>"

In order to find the steady state solution, the optimized algorithm performs simultaneous search in the parametric and slow variables spaces. We demonstrate that several GA modifications are required for effective convergence. Firstly, we used a mutation operator, based on Cauchy amplitude distribution along with a random direction in the parametric space. Secondly, relatively large number of elite organisms (6-10 % of the population passed on to new generation) was required for effective convergence. Test runs with synthetic AP as input data indicate that algorithm error is low for high amplitude ionic currents (1.6±1.6% for IKr, 3.2±3.5% for IK1, 3.9±3.5% for INa, 8.2±6.3% for ICaL). Experimental signal-to-noise ratio above 28 dB was required for high quality GA performance. GA was validated against optical mapping recordings of human ventricular AP and mRNA expression profile of donor hearts. In particular, GA output parameters were rescaled proportionally to mRNA levels ratio between patients. We have demonstrated that mRNA-based models predict the AP waveform dependence on heart rate with high precision. The latter also provides a novel technique of model personalization that makes it possible to map gene expression profile to cardiac function. </p>"

10.5061/dryad.18pd8,open,Data from: Low major histocompatibility complex class II variation in the endangered Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis): inferences about the role of balancing selection,"It has been widely reported that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is under balancing selection due to its immune function across terrestrial and aquatic mammals. The comprehensive studies at MHC and other neutral loci could give us a synthetic evaluation about the major force determining genetic diversity of species. Previously, a low level of genetic diversity has been reported among the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) using both mitochondrial marker and microsatellite loci. Here, the expression and sequence polymorphism of 2 MHC class II genes (DQB and DRB) in 32 S. chinensis from PRE collected between 2003 and 2011 were investigated. High ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates, codon-based selection analysis, and trans-species polymorphism (TSP) support the hypothesis that balancing selection acted on S. chinensis MHC sequences. However, only 2 haplotypes were detected at either DQB or DRB loci. Moreover, the lack of deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg expectation at DRB locus combined with the relatively low heterozygosity at both DQB locus and microsatellite loci suggested that balancing selection might not be sufficient, which further suggested that genetic drift associated with historical bottlenecks was not mitigated by balancing selection in terms of the loss of MHC and neutral variation in S. chinensis. The combined results highlighted the importance of maintaining the genetic diversity of the endangered S. chinensis."

10.5061/dryad.7pc2kc3,open,Data from: Molecular evolution of the proopiomelanocortin system in Barn owl species,"<p>Examination of genetic polymorphisms in outbred wild-living species provides insights into the evolution of complex systems. In higher vertebrates, the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor gives rise to α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which are involved in numerous physiological aspects. Genetic defects in POMC are linked to metabolic disorders in humans and animals. In the present study, we undertook an evolutionary genetics approach complemented with biochemistry to investigate the functional consequences of genetic polymorphisms in the POMC system of free-living outbred barn owl species (family Tytonidae) at the molecular level. Our phylogenetic studies revealed a striking correlation between a loss-of-function H9P mutation in the β-MSH receptor-binding motif and an extension of a poly-serine stretch in γ3-MSH to ≥7 residues that arose in the barn owl group 6-8 MYA ago. We found that extension of the poly-serine stretches in the γ-MSH locus affects POMC precursor processing, increasing g3-MSH production at the expense of g2-MSH and resulting in an overall reduction of g-MSH signaling, which may be part of a negative feedback mechanism. Extension of the γ3-MSH poly-serine stretches ≥7 further markedly increases peptide hormone stability in plasma, which is conserved in humans, and is likely relevant to its endocrine function. In sum<b>, </b>our phylogenetic analysis of POMC in wild living owls uncovered a H9P β-MSH mutation subsequent to serine extension in γ3-MSH to 7 residues, which was then followed by further serine extension. The linked MSH mutations highlight the genetic plasticity enabled by the modular design of the POMC gene.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.d20qc,open,Data from: The genetic architecture of methotrexate toxicity is similar in Drosophila melanogaster and humans,"The severity of the toxic side effects of chemotherapy varies among patients, and much of this variation is likely genetically based. Here, we use the model system Drosophila melanogaster to genetically dissect the toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), a drug used primarily to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis. We use the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from a multiparent advanced intercross, and quantify MTX toxicity as a reduction in female fecundity. We identify three quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting MTX toxicity; two colocalize with the fly orthologs of human genes believed to mediate MTX toxicity and one is a novel MTX toxicity gene with a human ortholog. A fourth suggestive QTL spans a centromere. Local single-marker association scans of candidate gene exons fail to implicate amino acid variants as the causative single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and we therefore hypothesize the causative variation is regulatory. In addition, the effects at our mapped QTL do not conform to a simple biallelic pattern, suggesting multiple causative factors underlie the QTL mapping results. Consistent with this observation, no single single-nucleotide polymorphism located in or near a candidate gene can explain the QTL mapping signal. Overall, our results validate D. melanogaster as a model for uncovering the genetic basis of chemotoxicity and suggest the genetic basis of MTX toxicity is due to a handful of genes each harboring multiple segregating regulatory factors."
10.5061/dryad.8w9ghx3km,open,Treefrogs adjust their acoustic signals in response to harmonics structure of intruder calls,"<p>Spectral properties of animal acoustic signals may help individuals to assess the characteristics of rivals and to adjust their competitive strategies in territorial disputes. Thus, we hypothesize that the distribution of energy across frequency bands in anuran calls determine behavioral responses in male-male competition. Using playback experiments, we investigated the relevance of the harmonic calls in the acoustic communication of the treefrog Dendropsophus minutus. We exposed territorial males to three synthetic acoustic stimuli composed of aggressive notes: (1) standard call (all harmonics and peak frequency corresponding to the second band); (2) inverted-energy call (all harmonics and peak frequency corresponding to the first band); and (3) concentrated-energy call (all energy contained in the second harmonic). Males responded aggressively to all stimuli, mainly by increasing the rate and duration of their aggressive notes. However, when exposed to stimuli with different harmonic configurations, males changed the harmonic structure of their own calls, emitting more A- and B-notes with peak power in the fundamental frequency, particularly when exposed to the concentrated-energy call. Our results suggest that male frogs may use the harmonic structure of calls to assess opponents and modulate territorial and aggressive behavior, triggering complex acoustic adjustments. This study contributes to our knowledge about the functions of acoustic traits in amphibian social interactions, and particularly of the presence of harmonics that has received less attention compared to other acoustic properties in the study of animal acoustic communication.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.f5n5c,open,Data from: Differential introgression and reorganization of retrotransposons in hybrid zones between wild wheats,"The maintenance of species integrity despite pervasive hybridization is ruled by the interplay between reproductive barriers. Endogenous postzygotic isolation will shape the patterns of introgression in hybrid zones, leading to variable outcomes depending on the genetic mechanism involved. Here, we analysed experimental and natural hybrid populations of Aegilops geniculata and Aegilops triuncialis to examine the genetics of species boundaries in the face of gene flow. Because long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) showing differential evolutionary trajectories are probably to affect hybrid dysgenesis and reproductive isolation between these wild wheat species, we addressed the impact of LTR-RTs in shaping introgression between them. Experimental settings involving artificial sympatry and enforced crossings quantified strong, but incomplete reproductive isolation, and highlighted asymmetrical endogenous postzygotic isolation between the two species. Natural hybrid zones located in the northern Golan Heights were analysed using plastid DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) marking random sequences, and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms (SSAP) tracking insertions from six LTR-RT families. This analysis demonstrated asymmetrical introgression and genome reorganization. In comparison with random sequences and quiescent LTR-RTs, those LTR-RTs predicted to be activated following conflicting interactions in hybrids revealed differential introgression across the hybrid zones. As also reported for synthetic F1 hybrids, such LTR-RTs were specifically reorganized in the genomes of viable hybrids, confirming that conflicts between selfish LTR-RTs may represent key incompatibilities shaping species boundaries and fostering long-term species integrity in the face of gene flow."

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown but there are several evidences that associate the genetic basis of the disease with environmental causes. An important association between viral infection and development of MS is clearly demonstrated. Viruses have a strong impact on innate immune cells. In particular, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), are able to respond to viruses and to activate the adaptive immune response.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;In this study we mimic viral infection using synthetic single-strand RNA, Resiquimod, and we compared the response of both DC subsets derived from healthy donors and MS patients by characterizing the expression of costimulatory molecules on the DC surface.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<p>We found that pDCs from MS patients express higher levels of OX40-L. Moreover, we found that blood cells from MS patients and healthy donors upon Resiquimod-stimulation are enriched in a subpopulation of pDCs, characterized by a high amount of costimulatory molecules.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, these results indicate that activation of pDCs is enhanced in MS, likely due to a latent viral infection, and that costimulatory molecules expressed on pDCs could mediate a protective response against the viral trigger of autoimmunity.</p>"

Discoveries in this field could be greatly accelerated by computational methods and resources that enable these findings to be compared across different studies and different organisms and linked with the genes responsible for anatomical modifications. Homology is a key concept in comparative anatomy; two important types are historical homology (the similarity of organisms due to common ancestry) and serial homology (the similarity of repeated structures within an organism). We explored how to most effectively represent historical and serial homology across anatomical structures to facilitate computational reasoning. We assembled a collection of homology assertions from the literature with a set of taxon phenotypes for vertebrate fins and limbs from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB). Using seven competency questions, we evaluated the reasoning ramifications of two logical models: the Reciprocal Existential Axioms Homology Model (REA) and the Ancestral Value Axioms Homology Model (AVA). Both models returned the user-expected results for all but one historical homology query and one serial homology query. Additionally, for each competency question, the AVA model returns the search term and any subtypes. We identify some challenges of implementing complete homology queries due to limitations of OWL reasoning. This work lays the foundation for homology reasoning to be incorporated into other ontology-based tools, such as those that enable synthetic supermatrix construction and candidate gene discovery."
10.5061/dryad.8n344,open,"Data from: Resources, key traits, and the size of fungal epidemics in Daphnia populations","1. Parasites can profoundly affect host populations and ecological communities. Thus, it remains critical to identify mechanisms that drive variation in epidemics. Resource availability can drive epidemics via traits of hosts and parasites that govern disease spread. 2. Here, we map resource–trait–epidemic connections to explain variation in fungal outbreaks (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in a zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera) among lakes. We predicted epidemics would grow larger in lakes with more phytoplankton via three energetic mechanisms. First, resources should stimulate Daphnia reproduction, potentially elevating host density. Secondly, resources should boost body size of hosts, enhancing exposure to environmentally distributed propagules through size-dependent feeding. Thirdly, resources should fuel parasite reproduction within hosts. 3. To test these predictions, we sampled 12 natural epidemics and tracked edible algae, fungal infection prevalence, body size, fecundity and density of hosts, as well as within-host parasite loads. 4. Epidemics grew larger in lakes with more algal resources. Structural equation modelling revealed that resource availability stimulated all three traits (host fecundity, host size and parasite load). However, only parasite load connected resources to epidemic size. Epidemics grew larger in more dense Daphnia populations, but host density was unrelated to host fecundity (thus breaking its link to resources). 5. Thus, via energetic mechanisms, resource availability can stimulate key trait(s) governing epidemics in nature. A synthetic focus on resources and resource–trait links could yield powerful insights into epidemics."
10.5061/dryad.tb58947,open,Data from: Within-individual variation in sexual displays: signal or noise?,"Animal sexual displays are typically repeated over time and consist of components that are also repeated within a display, creating potential for within-individual variation in signal production. Across taxa, patterns of variation in and female preferences for temporal properties of signals are well documented, but data describing how within-individual variation functions in communication are scarce. Is within-individual variation itself a signal of male quality, or noise that obscures another signal encoded by a temporal pattern? In this study of Cope's gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, we used synthetic advertisement calls to examine the function of within-individual variation in two signal traits: pulse rate, a signal of species identity, and call rate, a signal of male quality. We examined relationships between male body condition and coefficients of variation within males for both signal traits. We then measured female preferences for within-individual variation. Because treefrogs communicate in noisy social aggregations, we repeated the experiment in quiet and at three amplitudes of chorus-shaped noise to evaluate how within-individual variation affects mate choice in natural settings. Within-individual variation in signal production was not predicted by male condition and likely acts as noise in this communication system. Females strongly discriminated against highly variable call rates, but not pulse rates, when the mean trait values of signals were taken into account. At its highest level, chorus noise abolished this effect, suggesting female preferences against within-individual variation are unlikely to be expressed in dense social aggregations."

<p>Understanding causes and effects in mechanical systems is an essential component of reasoning in the physical world. This work poses a new problem of counterfactual learning of object mechanics from visual input. We develop the COPHY benchmark to assess the capacity of the state-of-the-art models for causal physical reasoning in a synthetic 3D environment. Having observed a mechanical experiment that involves, for example, a falling tower of blocks, a set of bouncing balls or colliding objects, we require to learn to predict how its outcome is affected by an arbitrary intervention on its initial conditions, such as displacing one of the objects in the scene.</p>

<p>The main objective for the creation of our benchmark is (a) to focus specifically on evaluating capabilities of state of the art models for performing counterfactual reasoning, (b) to be unbiased in terms of distributions of parameters to be estimated and balanced with respect to possible outcomes, and (c) to have sufficient variety in terms of scenarios<br>
and latent physical characteristics of the scene that are not visually observed and therefore can act<br>

Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers the ability to generate long-read sequencing data in real-time via portable protein nanopore USB devices. This work aimed to provide the user with the number of reads that should be sequenced, through ONT MinION platform, to reach the desired accuracy level for a human cell RNA study. We sequenced three cDNA libraries prepared from poly-adenosine RNA of human primary cardiac fibroblasts. Since the runs were comparable, they were combined in a total dataset of 48 million reads. Synthetic datasets with different sizes were generated starting from the total and analyzed in terms of the number of identified genes and their expression levels. As expected, an improved sensitivity was obtained increasing the sequencing depth, in particular for the non-coding genes. The reliability of expression levels was assayed by i) comparison with PCR quantifications of selected genes and ii) by the implementation of a user-friendly multiplexing method in a single run.</p>"

<p>The corpus is divided in two parts, depending of the source of the texts.</p>

<p>- The SYNTHETIC part is a collection of 285 documents specifically designed to test some functionalities a temporal tagger should cover, such as detecting basic expressions like &quot;It is five o&#39;clock&quot;. Tags such as &quot;Hour&quot;, &quot;Dates&quot; or &quot;False&quot; (this is, sentences where some confussing expression should not be tagged) were added to each document in order to facilitate their use (e.g., in the case the coverage of just a some type of expression needs to be tested).</p>

<p>- The PEOPLE part is a collection of 67 documents (although just 63 were added to the final HourGlass corpus due to their ambiguity) proposed by people foreign to the temporal annotation task. They were asked to write sentences with what they considered to be temporal expressions, and these sentences were afterwards analyzed and annotated. Besides the tags, also the register of the sentence (e.g. &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;Latin American&quot; or &quot;colloquial&quot;) were added.</p>

<p>All the documents are normalized using &quot;2019-12-20&quot; as anchor date.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.3v55m,open,Data from: Loci contributing to boric acid toxicity in two reference populations of Drosophila melanogaster,"Populations maintain considerable segregating variation in the response to toxic, xenobiotic compounds. To identify variants associated with resistance to boric acid, a commonly-used household insecticide with a poorly understood mechanism of action, we assayed thousands of individuals from hundreds of strains. Using the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), a multi-parental population (MPP) of inbred genotypes, we mapped six QTL to short genomic regions containing few protein-coding genes (3–188), allowing us to identify plausible candidate genes underlying resistance to boric acid toxicity. One interval contains multiple genes from the cytochrome P450 family, and we show that ubiquitous RNAi of one of these genes, Cyp9b2, markedly reduces resistance to the toxin. Resistance to boric acid is positively correlated with caffeine resistance. The two phenotypes additionally share a pair of QTL, potentially suggesting a degree of pleiotropy in the genetic control of resistance to these two distinct xenobiotics. Finally, we screened the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) in an attempt to identify sequence variants within mapped QTL that are associated with boric acid resistance. The approach was largely unsuccessful, with only one QTL showing any associations at QTL-specific 20% False Discovery Rate (FDR) thresholds. Nonetheless, these associations point to a potential candidate gene that can be targeted in future validation efforts. Although the mapping data resulting from the two reference populations do not clearly overlap, our work provides a starting point for further genetic dissection of the processes underlying boric acid toxicity in insects."

Recent advances in pathway elucidation and host expression systems now allow metabolic engineering of plant metabolic pathways to produce ""new-to-nature"" derivatives with novel biological activities, thereby amplifying the range of industrial uses for plant metabolites. Here we use a transient expression system in the model plant <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to reconstitute the two-step plant-derived biosynthetic pathway for auxin (indole acetic acid) to achieve accumulation up to 500 ng/g fresh mass (FM). By expressing these plant-derived enzymes in combination with either bacterial halogenases and alternative substrates, we can produce both natural and new-to-nature halogenated auxin derivatives up to 990 ng/g FM. Proteins from the auxin synthesis pathway, tryptophan aminotransferases (TARs) and flavin-dependent monooxygenases (YUCs), could be transiently expressed in combination with four separate bacterial halogenases to generate halogenated auxin derivatives. Brominated auxin derivatives could also be observed after infiltration of the transfected <i>N. benthamiana</i> with<i> </i>potassium bromide and the halogenases. Finally, the production of additional auxin derivatives could also be achieved by co-infiltration of TAR and YUC genes with various tryptophan analogues. Given the emerging importance of transient expression in <i>N. benthamiana</i> for industrial scale protein and product expression, this work provides insight into the capacity of <i>N. benthamiana</i> to interface bacterial genes and synthetic substrates to produce novel halogenated metabolites.</p>"

For this purpose, three pilot-scale systems were monitored for 175 days under outdoor conditions in Flanders. The systems were fed with the effluent of aquaculture (pikeperch production&mdash;PP), a mixture of diluted pig manure wastewater (PM), and a synthetic medium (SM). PM showed the highest productivity (6.1 &plusmn; 2.5 g DW m<sup>&minus;2</sup>&nbsp;d<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and N uptake (327 &plusmn; 107 mg N m<sup>&minus;2</sup>&nbsp;d<sup>&minus;1</sup>). PP yielded a similar productivity and both wastewaters resulted in higher productivities than SM. Furthermore, all media showed similar P uptake rates (65&ndash;70 P m<sup>&minus;2</sup>&nbsp;d<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Finally, duckweed had a beneficial amino acid composition for humans (essential amino acid index = 1.1), broilers and pigs. This study also showed that the growing medium had more influence on the productivity of duckweed than on its amino acid composition or protein content, with the latter being only slightly affected by the different media studied. Overall, these results demonstrate that duckweed can effectively remove nutrients from agriculture wastewaters while producing quality protein.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.f1vhhmgx9,open,Image-based automated species identification: Can virtual data augmentation overcome problems of insufficient sampling?,"<p></p><p>Automated species identification and delimitation is challenging, particularly in rare and thus often scarcely sampled species, which do not allow sufficient discrimination of infraspecific versus interspecific variation. Typical problems arising from either low or exaggerated interspecific morphological differentiation are best met by automated methods of machine learning that learn efficient and effective species identification from training samples. However, limited infraspecific sampling remains a key challenge also in machine learning.</p> <p>In this study, we assessed whether a data augmentation approach may help to overcome the problem of scarce training data in automated visual species identification. The stepwise augmentation of data comprised image rotation as well as visual and virtual augmentation. The visual data augmentation applies classic approaches of data augmentation and generation of artificial images using a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) approach. Descriptive feature vectors are derived from bottleneck features of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network (CNN) that are then stepwise reduced in dimensionality using Global Average Pooling and PCA to prevent overfitting. Finally, data augmentation employs synthetic additional sampling in feature space by an oversampling algorithm in vector space (SMOTE). Applied on four different image datasets, which include scarab beetle genitalia (Pleophylla, Schizonycha) as well as wing patterns of bees (Osmia) and cattleheart butterflies (Parides), our augmentation approach outperformed a deep learning baseline approach by means of resulting identification accuracy with non-augmented data as well as a traditional 2D morphometric approach (Procrustes analysis of scarab beetle genitalia).</p><p></p>"
10.5061/dryad.rm74c6b,open,Data from: Autopolyploidy alters nodule-level interactions in the legume-rhizobium mutualism,"Premise of the study: Polyploidy is a major genetic driver of ecological and evolutionary processes in plants, yet its effects on plant interactions with mutualistic microbes remain unresolved. The legume-rhizobium symbiosis regulates global nutrient cycles and plays a role in the diversification of legume taxa. In this mutualism, rhizobia bacteria fix nitrogen in exchange for carbon provided by legume hosts. This exchange occurs inside root nodules, which house bacterial cells and represent the interface of legume-rhizobial interactions. Although polyploidy may directly impact the legume-rhizobium mutualism, no studies have explored how it alters the internal structure of nodules.

Methods: We created synthetic autotetraploids using Medicago sativa subsp. caerulea. Neotetraploid plants and their diploid progenitors were singly inoculated with two strains of rhizobia, Sinorhizobium meliloti and S. medicae. Confocal microscopy was used to quantify internal traits of nodules produced by diploid and neotetraploid plants.

Key Results: Autotetraploid plants produced larger nodules with larger nitrogen fixation zones than diploids across both strains of rhizobia, although significance of this difference was limited by power. Neotetraploid M. sativa subsp. caerulea plants also produced symbiosomes that were significantly larger, nearly twice the size, than those present in diploids.

Conclusions: This study sheds light on how polyploidy directly affects a plant-bacterial mutualism and uncovers novel mechanisms. Changes in plant-microbe interactions that directly result from polyploidy likely contribute to the increased ability of polyploid legumes to establish in diverse environments."

10.5061/dryad.dk34h,open,Data from: The mayfly nymph Austrophlebioides pusillus Harker defies common osmoregulatory assumptions,"Osmoregulation is a key physiological function, critical for homeostasis. The basic physiological mechanisms of osmoregulation are thought to be well established. However, through a series of experiments exposing the freshwater mayfly nymph Austrophlebioides pusillus (Ephemeroptera) to increasing salinities, we present research that challenges the extent of current understanding of the relationship between osmoregulation and mortality. A. pusillus had modelled 96 h LC10, LC50 and LC99 of 2.4, 4.8 and 10 g l−1 added synthetic marine salt (SMS), respectively. They were strong osmoregulators. At aquarium water osmolality of 256 ± 3.12 mmol kg−1 (±s.e.; equivalent to 10 g l−1 added SMS), the haemolymph osmolality of A. pusillus was a much higher 401 ± 4.18 mmol kg−1 (±s.e.). The osmoregulatory capacity of A. pusillus did not break down, even at the salinity corresponding to their LC99, thus their mortality at this concentration is due to factors other than increased internal osmotic pressure. No freshwater invertebrate has been previously reported as suffering mortality from rises in salinity that are well below the iso-osmotic point. Recently, studies have reported reduced abundance/richness of Ephemeroptera with slightly elevated salinity. Given that salinization is an increasing global threat to freshwaters, there is an urgent need for studies into the osmophysiology of the Ephemeroptera to determine if their loss at locations with slightly elevated salinity is a direct result of external salinity or other, possibly physiological, causes."

There is a pressing need to automate this process. Previous research has achieved the automatic generation of surface primitives combined with rule-based classification to create labelled cuboids and cylinders from point clouds. While these methods work well in synthetic datasets or idealized cases, they encounter huge challenges when dealing with real-world bridge point clouds, which are often unevenly distributed and suffer from occlusions. In addition, real bridge geometries are complicated. In this paper, we propose a novel top-down method to tackle these challenges for detecting slab, pier, pier cap, and girder components in reinforced concrete bridges. This method uses a slicing algorithm to separate the deck assembly from pier assemblies. It then detects and segments pier caps using their surface normal, and girders using oriented bounding boxes and density histograms. Finally, our method merges over-segments into individually labelled point clusters. The results of 10 real-world bridge point cloud experiments indicate that our method achieves an average detection precision of 98.8%. This is the first method of its kind to achieve robust detection performance for the four component types in reinforced concrete bridges and to directly produce labelled point clusters. Our work provides a solid foundation for future work in generating rich Industry Foundation Classes models from the labelled point clusters.</em></p>"

(PAN) nanofibers. In contrast to the majority of the currently available nanofibrous wound dressings that are based on<br>
natural polymers, PAN employed in this study is a synthetic, industrial polymer that has rarely been considered for this<br>

(BSA)). Later, the biofunctionlized PAN NFs are induced to biomineralize by immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF).<br>
As a result, core-shell, calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (HA)/BSA/PAN nanofibers form, that are larger in<br>
diameter (318 vs. 298 nm) and mechanically stronger (elastic modulus; 8.5 vs. 6 MPa) compared to the untreated PAN<br>

keratinocyte cells. Hs68 fibroblasts and HaCat keratinocytes were found to be more viable in the presence of the<br>
biomineralized NFs than when they were co-cultured with the neat PAN NFs. Such mechanical and biological<br>
characteristics of the novel PAN NFs are favorable for wound dressing applications. More importantly, given the simple<br>

Globally, invasive non-native plants are an increasing threat to indigenous biodiversity and ecosystems, but management can be compromised by poor efficacy of control methods, harmful non-target effects or secondary invasions by other non-native plant species.</p>

<p>2. A 5-year field trial compared two stakeholder-selected control methods for heather, a European plant invading native ecosystems in and adjoining Tongariro National Park in New Zealand. The control methods were a selective herbicide (Pasture Kleen®; 2,4-D ester) and biocontrol with an introduced beetle Lochmaea suturalis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae).</p>

<p>4. Cover of native dicots, the most species-rich plant group, increased following biocontrol. In contrast, herbicide application had major non-target effects on native dicots, reducing their percentage cover and species richness. Native monocot cover and species richness increased following both herbicide and biocontrol treatments.</p>

<p>5. A similar 8-fold increase in non-native monocots occurred following both biocontrol and herbicide treatments. Overall, secondary invasion was greatest with biocontrol because non-native dicot cover also increased, whereas herbicide almost eliminated non-native dicots. 6. Synthesis and applications. Biocontrol and herbicide treatments both controlled heather but herbicide application was associated with severe non-target impacts on native dicots. Benefits to the native flora were consequently greatest in the biocontrol treatment, despite greater secondary invasion. Control strategies for management of widespread non-native plants to optimize ecosystem outcomes should include more consideration of biocontrol.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.5mkkwh752,open,The female pheromone (Z)-4-undecenal mediates flight attraction and courtship in Drosophila melanogaster,"Specific mate communication and recognition underlies reproduction and hence speciation. Mate communication evolves during adaptation to ecological niches and makes use of social signals and habitat cues.
Our study provides new insights in Drosophila melanogaster premating olfactory communication, showing that female pheromone (Z)-4-undecenal (Z4-11Al) and male pheromone cVA interact with food odour in a sex-specific manner. Furthermore, Z4-11Al, which mediates upwind flight attraction in both sexes, also elicits courtship in experienced males.
Twin variants of the olfactory receptor Or69a are co-expressed in the same olfactory sensory neurons, and feed into the same glomerulus in the antennal lobe. Z4-11Al is perceived via Or69aB, while the food odorant (R)-linalool is a main ligand for the other variant, Or69aA. That Z4-11Al mediates courtship in experienced males, not (R)-linalool, is probably due to courtship learning. Behavioural discrimination is reflected by calcium imaging of the antennal lobe, showing distinct glomerular activation patterns by these two compounds.
Male sex pheromone cVA is known to affect male and female courtship at close range, but does not elicit upwind flight attraction as a single compound, in to contrast to Z4-11Al. A blend of cVA and the food odour vinegar attracted females, while a blend of female pheromone Z4-11Al and vinegar attracted males instead.
Sex-specific upwind flight attraction to blends of food volatiles and male and female pheromone, respectively, adds a new element to Drosophila olfactory premating communication and is an unambiguous paradigm for identifying the behaviourally active components, towards a more complete concept of food-pheromone odour objects."

<p>A major part of the analysis of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) data is the comparison of observed fragment ion intensities to a library spectrum. Classically, these libraries are generated by data-dependent acquisition (DDA).

For this purpose, we targeted 1,529 precursors derived from synthetic viral peptides and analyzed the data with Prosit and DDA-derived libraries. Additionally, we used a spectral library predicted by Prosit and a DDA library to identify SARS-CoV-2 peptides from a simulated oropharyngeal swab.</p>

<p>A total of 1,569 crude synthetic viral peptides were ordered in six pools from JPT (Berlin, Germany). Synthetic peptides were separated on a 200 cm &mu;PAC&trade; column (PharmaFluidics) by using an EASY-nLC1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a &mu;PAC&trade; trapping column (PharmaFluidics). The flow rate was set to 300 nL/min and a stepped linear 160 min gradient was applied: 3-10% B in 22 min, 10-33%B in 95 min, 33-49% B in 23 min, 49-80% B in 10 min and 80% B for 10 min. Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA) in water, solvent B consisted of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) FA. The column temperature was set to 50 &deg;C.

10.5061/dryad.m37pvmcxq,open,Class-A penicillin binding proteins do not contribute to cell shape but repair cell-wall defects,"Cell shape and cell-envelope integrity of bacteria are determined by the peptidoglycan cell wall. In rod-shaped Escherichia coli, two conserved sets of machinery are essential for cell-wall insertion in the cylindrical part of the cell: the Rod complex and the class-A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs). While the Rod complex governs rod-like cell shape, aPBP function is less well understood. aPBPs were previously hypothesized to either work in concert with the Rod complex or to independently repair cell-wall defects. First, we demonstrate through modulation of enzyme levels that aPBPs do not contribute to rod-like cell shape but are required for mechanical stability, supporting their independent activity. By combining measurements of cell-wall stiffness, cell-wall insertion, and PBP1b motion at the single-molecule level, we then present evidence that PBP1b, the major aPBP, contributes to cell-wall integrity by repairing cell wall defects."
10.5281/zenodo.4720668,open,Comparative and phylogenomic analysis of nuclear and organelle genes in cryptic Coelastrella vacuolata MACC-549 green algae,"<p>Phylogenetic analysis was carried out by using 3 nucleotide (18S, ITS2 and <em>tufA</em>) and 7 protein sequences (PetA, PsbD, PsaC, PsbB, RbcL, AtpA, and PsaB proteins coded on the chloroplast genome). The bulk of all the sequences used were downloaded from a previous study - Wang et. al. 2019. Multiple alignments of separate loci were created by using the L-INS-i Iterative refinement method in MAFFT v.7.427. &nbsp;The multiple alignments were manually curated to correct false base mismatches introduced by the automatic multiple alignment algorithm. We also provide these multiple sequence alignments herewith for anyone to use with their own dataset to phylogenetically classify members within&nbsp;Sphaeropleales.</p>

<p>After alignment, highly variable and non-informative sites from the alignments were removed using GBlocks (v.91b). Minimum number of sequences for a conserved position and for a flank position were set to 50% of the number of sequences plus one, maximum number of contiguous non-conserved positions was set to 20, minimum length of a block was set to 2 and we allowed a gap position in all sequences.&nbsp;The 3 nucleotide sequences were concatenated into a single aligned sequence, referred to as the &ldquo;Conventional loci alignment&rdquo;. We also assembled a 10 loci alignment by concatenating the 3 nucleotide and 7 protein sequences into one alignment.&nbsp; Overall, two phylogenetic trees were inferred by iqTree2. These trees are also provided herewith for those who would like to try it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The files ending in *.fasta (sequence_18s_v2_aligned.fasta, sequence_fixedITS2_newnames_aligned_edited.fasta and sequence_tufA_v2_aligned.fasta) all contain individual alignments for the 3 nucleotide sequences. All files ending in *.seqs (atpA_aligned.seqs, petA_aligned.seqs, psaB_aligned.seqs, psaC_aligned.seqs, psbB_aligned.seqs, psbD_aligned.seqs, rbcL_aligned.seqs)&nbsp;contain individual alignments for the 7 protein sequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The nucleotide sequences are concatenated within Traditional_tree_concatenated_v2.fas and the protein sequences are concatenated in concatenated_proteins_v2.faa.&nbsp;The mixed_loci.tre file is the tree file produced by mixing both the nucleotide and protein sequence. The traditional_loci.tre file is the tree file produced with only the three nucleotide sequences. Finally, the nexus file required for iqTree2 runs are provided in partitions_mixed.txt (use with concatenated_proteins_v2.faa) and partitions_traditional_tree.txt (use with Traditional_tree_concatenated_v2.fas)</p>

10.5281/zenodo.1462432,open,Artificially-generated Lecture Video Fragmentation Dataset and Ground Truth,"<p>We provide a large-scale lecture video dataset consisting of artificially-generated lectures, and the corresponding ground-truth fragmentation, for the purpose of evaluating lecture video fragmentation techniques.</p>

<p>For creating this dataset, 1498 speech transcript files (generated automatically by ASR software) were used from the world&#39;s biggest academic online video repository, the VideoLectures.NET. These transcripts correspond to lectures from various fields of science, such as Computer science, Mathematics, Medicine, Politics etc. In order to create the synthetic video lectures, all transcripts were randomly split in fragments, the duration of which ranges between 4 and 8 minutes. Each synthetic lecture was then assembled by combining (stitching) exactly 20 randomly selected fragments. 300 such artificially-generated lectures are included in the released dataset. Each such lecture file has a mean duration of about 120 minutes, thus the dataset contains altogether about 600 hours of artificially-generated lectures. Every pair of consecutive fragments in these lectures originally comes from different videos, consequently the point in time where such two fragments are joined is a known ground-truth fragment boundary. All these boundaries form the dataset&#39;s ground truth. We should stress that we do not generate the corresponding video files for the artificially-generated lectures (only the transcripts), and one should not try to reverse-engineer the dataset creation process so as to use in some way the visual modality for detecting the fragments in this dataset.</p>

<p><strong>File format</strong></p>

<p>After you download the provided .zip and unpack it, the extracted folder will contain two sub-folders:</p>

<pre><code>1. ALV_srt
2. ALV_srt_GT
</code></pre>

<p>Each of them contains 300 files.</p>

<p>The <strong>ALV_srt</strong> folder contains the transcripts of every artificially-generated lecture, in the standard SRT format:</p>

<pre><code>1. A numeric counter identifying each sequential subtitle
2. The time that the subtitle should appear on the screen, followed by --&gt; and the time it should disappear
3. Subtitle's text itself on one or more lines
4. A blank line containing no text
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>ALV_srt_GT</strong> folder contains the ground truth (GT) fragments corresponding to the lectures (transcripts) of the <strong>ALV_srt</strong> folder. Each GT file consists of 3 tab-separated columns and 20 rows, in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Fragment_ID_1&gt;	&lt;StartTime_1&gt;	&lt;EndTime_1&gt;
&lt;Fragment_ID_2&gt;	&lt;StartTime_2&gt;	&lt;EndTime_2&gt;

.
.
.
&lt;Fragment_ID_20&gt;	&lt;StartTime_20&gt;	&lt;EndTime_20&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Each row indicates a fragment. The first column indicates the ID of a fragment while the second and the third column indicate the start and the end time of the fragment respectively.</p>

10.5061/dryad.ct70q,open,Data from: Using Drosophila melanogaster to identify chemotherapy toxicity genes,"The severity of the toxic side effects of chemotherapy shows a great deal of interindividual variability, and much of this variation is likely genetically based. Simple DNA tests predictive of toxic side effects could revolutionize the way chemotherapy is carried out. Due to the challenges in identifying polymorphisms that affect toxicity in humans, we use Drosophila fecundity following oral exposure to carboplatin, gemcitabine and mitomycin C as a model system to identify naturally occurring DNA variants predictive of toxicity. We use the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from a multiparent advanced intercross, to map quantitative trait loci affecting chemotoxicity. We identify two QTL each for carboplatin and gemcitabine toxicity and none for mitomycin. One QTL is associated with fly orthologs of a priori human carboplatin candidate genes ABCC2 and MSH2, and a second QTL is associated with fly orthologs of human gemcitabine candidate genes RRM2 and RRM2B. The third, a carboplatin QTL, is associated with a posteriori human orthologs from solute carrier family 7A, INPP4A&amp;B, and NALCN. The fourth, a gemcitabine QTL that also affects methotrexate toxicity, is associated with human ortholog GPx4. Mapped QTL each explain a significant fraction of variation in toxicity, yet individual SNPs and transposable elements in the candidate gene regions fail to singly explain QTL peaks. Furthermore, estimates of founder haplotype effects are consistent with genes harboring several segregating functional alleles. We find little evidence for nonsynonymous SNPs explaining mapped QTL; thus it seems likely that standing variation in toxicity is due to regulatory alleles."
10.5061/dryad.4cc5m,open,Data from: Integrated radar and lidar analysis reveals extensive loss of remaining intact forest on Sumatra 2007–2010,"Forests with high above ground biomass (AGB), including those growing on peat swamps, have historically not been thought suitable for biomass mapping and change detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). However, by integrating L-band (λ = 0.23 m) SAR with lidar data from the ALOS and ICESat earth-observing satellites respectively, and 56 forest plots, we were able to create a forest biomass and change map for a 10.7 Mha section of eastern Sumatra that still contains high AGB peat swamp forest. Using a time series of SAR data we estimated changes in both forest area and AGB. We estimate that there were 274 ± 68 Tg AGB remaining in natural forest (≥ 20 m height) in the study area in 2007, with this stock reducing by approximately 11.4% over the subsequent 3 years. A total of 137.4 kha of the study area were deforested between 2007 and 2010; an average rate of 3.8% yr−1. The ability to attribute forest loss to different initial biomass values allows for far more effective monitoring and baseline modelling for avoided deforestation projects than traditional, optical-based remote sensing. Furthermore, given SAR's ability to penetrate the smoke and cloud which normally obscure land cover change in this region, SAR-based forest monitoring can be relied on to provide frequent imagery. This study demonstrates that even at L-band, which typically saturates at medium biomass levels (ca. 150 Mg ha−1), it is possible to make reliable estimates of not just the area but the carbon emissions resulting from land use change."
10.5281/zenodo.1122635,open,Turbulent and laminar flow in karst conduits under unsteady flow conditions – interpretation of pumping tests by discrete conduit-continuum modeling,"<p>Due to the duality in terms of (1) the groundwater flow field and (2) the discharge conditions, flow patterns of karst aquifer systems are complex. Estimated aquifer parameters may differ by several orders of magnitude from local (borehole) to regional (catchment) scale because of the large aquifer heterogeneity and anisotropy. One approach to deal with this scale problem in karst aquifers is the application of large-scale experiments such as long-term high-abstraction conduit pumping tests, stimulating measurable groundwater drawdown in both, the karst conduit system as well as the fissured and fractured aquifer matrix. The numerical discrete conduit-continuum modeling approach MODFLOW-2005 Conduit Flow Process Mode1 (CFPM1) is employed to simulate laminar and non-laminar conduit flow, induced by large-scale experiments, in combination with Darcian matrix flow. Effects of large-scale experiments were simulated for idealized settings. Subsequently, diagnostic plots and analyses of different fluxes are applied to interpret differences in the simulated conduit drawdown and general flow patterns.</p>

<p>The main focus is set on the question to which extent different conduit flow regimes will affect the conduit as well as the matrix drawdown depending on the hydraulic properties of the conduit system, i.e. conduit diameter and relative roughness In this context, CFPM1 is applied to investigate the significance of turbulent flow consideration for the simulation of karst conduit flow. This work quantifies the relative error that results from assuming laminar conduit flow for the interpretation of a synthetic large-scale pumping test in karst.</p>

10.5061/dryad.477dp5c,open,Data from: Sex differences in the drivers of reproductive skew in a cooperative breeder,"Many cooperatively breeding societies are characterized by high reproductive skew, such that some socially dominant individuals breed, while socially subordinate individuals provide help. Inbreeding avoidance serves as a source of reproductive skew in many high-skew societies, but few empirical studies have examined sources of skew operating alongside inbreeding avoidance, or compared individual attempts to reproduce (reproductive competition) with individual reproductive success. Here we use long-term genetic and observational data to examine factors affecting reproductive skew in the high-skew cooperatively breeding southern pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor). When subordinates can breed, skew remains high, suggesting factors additional to inbreeding avoidance drive skew. Subordinate females are more likely to compete to breed when older or when ecological constraints on dispersal are high, but heavy subordinate females are more likely to successfully breed. Subordinate males are more likely to compete when they are older, during high ecological constraints, or when they are related to the dominant male, but only the presence of within-group unrelated subordinate females predicts subordinate male breeding success. Reproductive skew is not driven by reproductive effort, but by forces such as intrinsic physical limitations and intra-sexual conflict (for females), or female mate choice, male mate-guarding and potentially reproductive restraint (for males). Ecological conditions or 'outside options' affect the occurrence of reproductive conflict, supporting predictions of recent synthetic skew models. Inbreeding avoidance together with competition for access to reproduction may generate high skew in animal societies, and disparate processes may be operating to maintain male vs. female reproductive skew in the same species."
10.5061/dryad.f357r,open,Data from: Concurrent temporal channels for auditory processing: oscillatory neural entrainment reveals segregation of function at different scales,"Natural sounds convey perceptually relevant information over multiple timescales, and the necessary extraction of multi-timescale information requires the auditory system to work over distinct ranges. The simplest hypothesis suggests that temporal modulations are encoded in an equivalent manner within a reasonable intermediate range. We show that the human auditory system selectively and preferentially tracks acoustic dynamics concurrently at 2 timescales corresponding to the neurophysiological theta band (4–7 Hz) and gamma band ranges (31–45 Hz) but, contrary to expectation, not at the timescale corresponding to alpha (8–12 Hz), which has also been found to be related to auditory perception. Listeners heard synthetic acoustic stimuli with temporally modulated structures at 3 timescales (approximately 190-, approximately 100-, and approximately 30-ms modulation periods) and identified the stimuli while undergoing magnetoencephalography recording. There was strong intertrial phase coherence in the theta band for stimuli of all modulation rates and in the gamma band for stimuli with corresponding modulation rates. The alpha band did not respond in a similar manner. Classification analyses also revealed that oscillatory phase reliably tracked temporal dynamics but not equivalently across rates. Finally, mutual information analyses quantifying the relation between phase and cochlear-scaled correlations also showed preferential processing in 2 distinct regimes, with the alpha range again yielding different patterns. The results support the hypothesis that the human auditory system employs (at least) a 2-timescale processing mode, in which lower and higher perceptual sampling scales are segregated by an intermediate temporal regime in the alpha band that likely reflects different underlying computations."

Tabernanthe iboga or iboga (Apocynaceae) is native to western equatorial Africa and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Howard Lotsof is credited with bringing iboga to the attention of Western medicine through his accidental discovery that iboga can alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms. Since this observation, iboga has been investigated for its use in the general management of addiction. We were interested in elucidating ibogaine biosynthesis to understand the unique reaction steps en route to ibogaine. Furthermore, because ibogaine is currently sourced from plant material, these studies may help improve the ibogaine supply chain through synthetic biology approaches. Here we used next-generation sequencing to generate the first iboga transcriptome, and leveraged homology guided gene discovery to identify the penultimate hydroxylase and final O-methyltransferase steps in ibogaine biosynthesis, herein named ibogamine 10-hydroxylase (I10H) and noribogaine 10-O-methyltransferase (N10OMT). Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (I10H) or Escherichia coli (N10OMT) and incubation with putative precursors, along with HPLC–MS analysis,
confirmed the predicted activities of both enzymes. Moreover, high expression levels of their transcripts were detected in ibogaine-accumulating plant tissues. These discoveries coupled with our publicly available iboga transcriptome will contribute to additional gene discovery efforts and could lead to the stabilization of the global ibogaine supply chain and to the development of ibogaine as a treatment for addiction."

Riboflavin (RF)-doped synthetic double-crossover DNA (DX-DNA) lattices and natural salmon DNA (SDNA) thin films are constructed using substrate assisted growth and drop-casting methods, respectively, and their topological, chemical, and electro-optical characteristics were evaluated. The critical doping concentration of RF ([RF]C, ~5 mM) at given concentrations of DX-DNA and SDNA were obtained by observing the phase transition (from crystalline to amorphous structures) of DX-DNA and precipitation of SDNA in solution above [RF]C. [RF]C are verified by analyzing the atomic force microscopy images for DX-DNA and current, absorbance, and photoluminescence for SDNA. We study the physical characteristics of RF-embedded SDNA thin films, which are the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum to understand the interaction between the RF and DNA molecules, current to evaluate the conductance, absorption to understand the RF binding to the DNA, and photoluminescence (PL) to analyze the energy transfer between the RF and DNA. The current and UV absorbance band of SDNA thin films decrease up to [RF]C followed by an increase above [RF]C. In contrast, the PL intensity illustrates the reverse trend, as compared to the current and UV absorbance behavior as a function of the varying [RF]. Due to the intense PL characteristic of RF, the DNA lattices and thin films with RF might offer immense potential to develop efficient bio-sensors and useful bio-photonic devices."

10.5061/dryad.51591,open,Data from: Competitive release and outbreaks of non-target pests associated with transgenic Bt cotton,"The adoption of transgenic Bt cotton has, in some cases, led to environmental and economic benefits through reduced insecticide use. However, the distribution of these benefits and associated risks among cotton growers and cotton-growing regions, has been uneven due in part to outbreaks of non-target or secondary pests, thereby requiring the continued use of synthetic insecticides. In the southeastern United States, Bt cotton adoption has resulted in increased abundance of and damage from stink bug pests, Euschistus servus and Nezara viridula (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). While the impact of increased stink bug abundance has been well-documented, the causes have remained unclear. We hypothesize that release from competition with Bt-susceptible target pests may drive stink bug outbreaks in Bt cotton. We first examined the evidence for competitive release of stink bugs through meta-analysis of previous studies. We then experimentally tested if herbivory by Bt-susceptible Helicoverpa zea increases stink bug leaving rates and deters oviposition on non-Bt cotton. Consistent with previous studies, we found differences in leaving rates only for E. servus, but we found that both species strongly avoided ovipositing on H. zea-damaged plants. Considering all available evidence, competitive release of stink bug populations in Bt cotton likely contributes to outbreaks, though the relative importance of competitive release remains an open question. Ecological risk assessments of Bt crops and other transgenic insecticidal crops would benefit from greater understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying non-target pest outbreaks and greater attention to indirect ecological effects more broadly."

10.5061/dryad.q8h75,open,Data from: Functional C-terminally encoded peptide (CEP) plant hormone domains evolved de novo in the plant parasite Rotylenchulus reniformis,"Sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) induce and maintain an intimate relationship with their host, stimulating cells adjacent to root vascular tissue to re-differentiate into unique and metabolically active 'feeding sites'. The interaction between PPNs and their host is mediated by nematode effectors. We describe the discovery of a large and diverse family of effector genes, encoding C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP) plant hormone mimics (RrCEPs), in the syncytia-forming plant parasite Rotylenchulus reniformis. The particular attributes of RrCEPs distinguish them from all other CEPs, regardless of origin. Together with the distant phylogenetic relationship of R. reniformis to the only other CEP-encoding nematode genus identified to date (Meloidogyne), this suggests that CEPs probably evolved de novo in R. reniformis. We have characterized the first member of this large gene family (RrCEP1), demonstrating its significant up-regulation during the plant–nematode interaction and expression in the effector-producing pharyngeal gland cell. All internal CEP domains of multi-domain RrCEPs are followed by di-basic residues, suggesting a mechanism for cleavage. A synthetic peptide corresponding to RrCEP1 domain 1 is biologically active and capable of up-regulating plant nitrate transporter (AtNRT2.1) expression, whilst simultaneously reducing primary root elongation. When a non-CEP-containing, syncytia-forming PPN species (Heterodera schachtii) infects Arabidopsis in a CEP-rich environment, a smaller feeding site is produced. We hypothesize that CEPs of R. reniformis represent a two-fold adaptation to sustained biotrophy in this species: (i) increasing host nitrate uptake, whilst (ii) limiting the size of the syncytial feeding site produced."
10.5061/dryad.34274,open,Data from: Exon capture phylogenomics: efficacy across scales of divergence,"The evolutionary histories of species are not measured directly, but estimated using genealogies inferred for particular loci. Individual loci can have discordant histories, but in general we expect to infer evolutionary histories more accurately as more of the genome is sampled. High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is now providing opportunities to incorporate thousands of loci in 'phylogenomic' studies. Here, we used target enrichment to sequence c.3000 protein-coding exons in a group of Australian skink lizards (crown group age c.80 Ma). This method uses synthetic probes to 'capture' target exons that were identified in the transcriptomes of selected probe design (PD) samples. The target exons are then enriched in sample DNA libraries prior to performing HTS. Our main goal was to study the efficacy of enrichment of targeted loci at different levels of phylogenetic divergence from the PD species. In taxa sharing a common ancestor with PD samples up to c.20 Ma, we detected little reduction in efficacy, measured here as sequencing depth of coverage. However, at around 80 Myr divergence from the PD species, we observed an approximately two-fold reduction in efficacy. A secondary goal was to develop a workflow for analysing exon capture studies of phylogenetically diverse samples, while minimizing potential bias. Our approach assembles each exon in each sample separately, by first recruiting short sequencing reads having homology to the corresponding protein sequence. In sum, custom exon capture provides a complement to existing, more generic target capture methods and is a practical and robust option across low-moderate levels of phylogenetic divergence."

In this study, we evaluated the impacts of the synthetic GLP-1RA Liraglutide on bone mass and quality in osteoporotic rats induced by ovariectomy (OVX) but without diabetes, as well as its effect on the adipogenic and osteoblastogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Three months after sham surgery or bilateral OVX, eighteen 5-month old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups to receive the following treatments for 2 months: (1) Sham + normal saline; (2) OVX + normal saline; and (3) OVX + Liraglutide (0.6 mg/day). As revealed by micro-CT analysis, Liraglutide improved trabecular volume, thickness and number, increased BMD, and reduced trabecular spacing in the femurs in OVX rats; similar results were observed in the lumbar vertebrae of OVX rats treated with Liraglutide. Following <i>in vitro</i> treatment of rat and human BMSCs with 10 nM Liraglutide, there was a significant increase in the mRNA expression of osteoblast-specific transcriptional factor Runx2 and the osteoblast markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and collagen ?1 (Col-1), but a significant decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?). In conclusion, our results indicate that the anti-diabetic drug Liraglutide can exert a bone protective effect even in non-diabetic osteoporotic OVX rats. This protective effect is likely attributable to the impact of Liraglutide on the lineage fate determination of BMSCs."
10.5061/dryad.10454g0,open,Data from: Acoustic stability in hyrax snorts: vocal tightrope-walkers or wrathful verbal assailants?,"The source-filter theory proposes that information on caller properties is communicated through acoustic qualities, as physical state and performance ability are reflected in the voice. Vocal stability, manifested through harshness is especially intriguing, and has rarely been explored although harsh sounds are prevalent in nature. Male rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis) produce loud complex calls that we term songs. Only the calls of older, socially dominant males, include a harsh sound termed snort. As snorts are the rarest element in songs, we hypothesized that high quality snorts are difficult to produce, and that their quality consists in the ability to maintain smoothness throughout this low-pitched, harsh call. We quantified harshness by measuring periodicity deviations and expected to find a link between social parameters (residence, rank, and weight) and the ability to produce longer, smoother snorts. In addition, we presumed that if calls are used as vocal contests, conspecifics would avoid answering songs that exhibit a higher acoustic ability than their own songs. We found that in wild hyrax songs, snort harshness was associated with both weight and social rank, but in opposite directions. Heavier males produced smoother snorts and higher ranked individuals produced harsher snorts, possibly indicating aggressiveness. Playback experiments showed that longer and harsher synthetic snorts, inserted into natural songs, reduced conspecific answer rates. Snorts may communicate complex information on hyrax weight and dominance by means of element length and harshness. Our present results provide a stimulating insight into the understanding of acoustics in mammalian vocal communication."

Twin sets of identical model experiments differing in initial conditions (IC) with the former (later) using NCEP IC (new IC; NIC) are performed. The NIC experiment shows consistent enhancement of ENSO skill compared to NCEP IC. This advancement leads to the improvement of ISMR skill. We found that the significant improvement of surface and sub-surface temperature, thermocline depth, and heat content over the global ocean particularly in the Nino3 region in the NIC compared to NCEP IC contributed to the improved ISMR skills. This enhanced ISMR skill score might be the result of reduced model drift in the NIC even on 4 month lead and capturing the ISMR – ENSO teleconnection with great fidelity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>"

We performed two experiments with a duetting vibrational insect, Enchenopa binotata treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae), to ask whether males adjust their signalling behaviour according to (1a) their own experience of competitors' signals, (1b) how females adjust their mate preferences on the basis of their experience of male signals (described in prior work), and/or (2) their own experience of female response signals to competitors' signals. We presented males with synthetic male signals of different frequencies and combinations thereof for 2 weeks. We recorded males a day after their last signal exposure, finding that (1a) male signal rate increased in response to experience of attractive competitors, but that (1b) male signal frequency did not shift in a manner consistent with how females adjust their mate preferences in those experience treatments. Second, we presented males with different male–female duets for 2 weeks, finding that (2) male signal length increased from experience of female duets with attractive competitors. Males thus make two types of adjustment according to two sources of public information: one provided by experience of male signals and another by experience of female responses to male signals. Signalling plasticity can generate feedback loops between the adjustments that males and females make, and we discuss the potential consequences of such feedback loops for the evolution of communication systems."

Yet, a classifier selected at the start of the trial based on smaller and more accessible datasets may yield inaccurate and unstable classification performance. In this paper, we aim to address two common concerns in classifier selection for clinical trials: (1) predicting expected classifier performance for large datasets based on error rates calculated from smaller datasets and (2) the selection of appropriate classifiers based on expected performance for larger datasets. We present a framework for comparative evaluation of classifiers using only limited amounts of training data by using random repeated sampling (RRS) in conjunction with a cross-validation sampling strategy. Extrapolated error rates are subsequently validated via comparison with leave-one-out cross-validation performed on a larger dataset. The ability to predict error rates as dataset size increases is demonstrated on both synthetic data as well as three different computational imaging tasks: detecting cancerous image regions in prostate histopathology, differentiating high and low grade cancer in breast histopathology, and detecting cancerous metavoxels in prostate magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For each task, the relationships between 3 distinct classifiers (k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine) are explored. Further quantitative evaluation in terms of interquartile range (IQR) suggests that our approach consistently yields error rates with lower variability (mean IQRs of 0.0070, 0.0127, and 0.0140) than a traditional RRS approach (mean IQRs of 0.0297, 0.0779, and 0.305) that does not employ cross-validation sampling for all three datasets."

The evolutionary arms race between Asian honey bees and their hornet predators has led to a remarkable defence, heat-balling, which suffocates hornets with heat and carbon dioxide.

The allopatric species,&nbsp;<em>Apis</em><em>mellifera</em>(Am), only weakly responded to a live hornet&nbsp;and Am alarm pheromone, butnot to hornet alarm pheromone. We observed typical hornet alarm pheromone releasing behaviour, hornet sting extension, when guard bees initially attacked. Once heat balls were formed, guards released honey bee sting alarm pheromones: isopentyl acetate, octyl acetate, (<em>E</em>)-2-decen-1-yl acetate, and benzyl acetate. Only Ac heat-balled in response to realistic bee alarm pheromone component levels, &lt;1 bee-equivalent (1 &micro;g), of isopentyl acetate. Detailed eavesdropping experiments showed that Ac, but not Am, formed heat-balls in response to a synthetic blend of hornet alarm pheromone. Only Ac antennae showed strong, consistent responses to hornet alarm pheromone compounds and venom volatiles. These data provide the first evidence that the sympatric Ac, but not the allopatric Am, can eavesdrop upon hornet alarm pheromone and uses this information, in addition to bee alarm pheromone, to heat-ball hornets. Evolution has likely given Ac this eavesdropping ability, an adaptation that the allopatric Am does not possess.</p>"

<p>Large&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;small&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;problem is a challenging problem in big data analytics. There are no de facto standard methods available to it. In this study, we propose a tensor decomposition (TD) based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) formalism applied to multiomics datasets, where the number of features is more than 100000 while the number of instances is as small as about 100. The proposed TD based unsupervised FE outperformed other conventional supervised feature selection methods, such as random forest, categorical regression (also known as analysis of variance, ANOVA), and penalized linear discriminant analysis when they are applied to not only multiomics datasets but also synthetic datasets. Genes selected by TD based unsupervised FE were biologically reliable. TD based unsupervised FE turned out to be not only the superior feature selection method but also the method that can select biologically reliable genes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Nevertheless, its prevalence in the chironomid egg masses' microbiota is less than 0.5%. <i>V. cholerae</i> secretes haemagglutinin/protease (HAP) that degrades the gelatinous matrix of chironomid egg masses and prevents hatching. Quorum sensing (QS) activates HAP production in response to accumulation of bacterial autoinducers (AIs). Our aim was to define the impact of chironomid microbiota on HAP production by <i>V. cholerae</i>. To study QS signaling, we used<i> V. cholerae</i> bioluminescence reporter strains (QS-proficient O1 El-Tor wild type and QS-deficient mutants) and different bacterial species that we isolated from chironomid egg masses. These egg mass isolates, as well as a synthetic AI-2, caused an enhancement in <i>lux</i> expression by a <i>V. cholerae</i> QS-deficient mutant. The addition of the egg mass bacterial isolate supernatant to the QS-deficient mutant also enhanced HAP production and egg mass degradation activities. Moreover, the <i>V. cholerae</i> wild type strain was able to proliferate using egg masses as their sole carbon source while the QS-deficient was not. The results demonstrate that members of the chironomid bacterial consortium produce external chemical cues that, like AI-2, induce expression of the<i> hapA </i>gene in <i>V. cholerae</i>. Understanding the interactions between <i>V. cholerae</i> and the insects' microbiota may help uncover the interactions between this pathogen and the human gut microbiota.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.5885654,open,Static Code Analysis Alarms Filtering Reloaded: an ML Approach and its Empirical Evaluation on a New Real-World Dataset,"<p>This is a replication data package for a paper titled &quot;<em>Static Code Analysis Alarms Filtering Reloaded: an ML Approach and its Empirical Evaluation on a New Real-World Dataset</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>Paper abstract: Even though Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools are integrated into many modern software building and testing pipelines, their practical impact is still seriously hindered by the excessive number of false positive warnings they usually produce. To cope with this problem, researchers have proposed several post-processing methods that aim to filter out false hits (or equivalently identify ``actionable&#39;&#39; warnings) after the SCA tool produced its results. However, we found that most of these approaches are targeted (i.e., deal with only a few SCA warning types) and evaluated on synthetic benchmarks or small-scale manually collected data sets (i.e., with typical sample sizes of several hundred).</p>

<p>In this paper, we present a code embedding-based approach for filtering false positive warnings produced by 160 different SonarQube rule checks, one of the most widely adopted SCA tools today. We evaluate the method on a dataset containing 224,484 real-world warning samples fixed (true positive samples) or ignored (false positive samples) by the developers, which we collected from 9,958 different open-source Java projects from GitHub using a data mining approach. It is the most extensive real-world study and public dataset we know of in this area. Our method works with an accuracy of 91% (best F1-score of 81.3% and AUC of 95.3%) for the classification of SonarQube warnings.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.j6q573ncw,open,"Data for: Nectar-dwelling microbes of common tansy are attractive to its mosquito pollinator, Culex pipiens","<p>There is widespread interkingdom signalling between insects and microbes. For example, microbes found in floral nectar may modify its nutritional composition and produce odorants that alter the floral odor bouquet which may attract insect pollinators. Mosquitoes consume nectar and can pollinate flowers. We identified microbes isolated from nectar of common tansy, Tanacetum vulgare , identified the microbial odorants, and tested their effect on attracting the common house mosquito, Culex pipiens . Results We collected 19 microbial isolates from T. vulgare nectar, representing at least 12 different taxa which we identified with 16S or 26S rDNA sequencing as well as by biochemical and physiological tests. Three microorganisms, Lachancea thermotolerans, Micrococcus lactis , Micrococcus luteus , were grown on culture medium and tested in bioassays. L. thermotolerans grown on nectar, malt extract agar, or in synthetic nectar broth significantly attracted C. pipiens females. The odorant profile produced by L. thermotolerans varied depending on the composition of the culture medium used. Surprisingly, all three microbes grown separately, but presented concurrently, attracted fewer C. pipiens females than L. thermotolerans by itself. Conclusions Floral nectar of T. vulgare contains various microbes whose odorants contribute to the odor profile of inflorescences. In addition, one of the microbes, the yeast L. thermotolerans, produced odorants that attract Cx. pipiens females. As the odor profile of L. thermotolerans varied with the composition of the culture medium, we hypothesize that microbe odorants inform nectar-foraging mosquitoes about the availability of certain macronutrients which, in turn, affect foraging decisions by mosquitoes.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.3732981,open,Dataset for Seismic waveform tomography of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean upper mantle,"<p><strong>Dataset corresponding to the Seismic waveform tomography of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean upper mantle</strong></p>

<p>This dataset belongs to the seismic waveform tomography of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean by Blom, Gokhberg and Fichtner, Solid Earth (Discussions), 2019. Seismic tomography is an inverse problem where the internal elastic structure of the Earth (the upper ~500 km) is determined from seismograms (the vibrations of the Earth as a result of earthquakes, as recorded by seismometers at the Earth&#39;s surface). This inverse problem is cast as an optimisation where the misfit between observed and synthetic seismograms is minimised: waveform tomography (often referred to as full waveform inversion or FWI). Synthetic seismograms are produced by simulating the elastic wavefield of earthquakes within the Earth. The optimisation problem is solved by iterative, deterministic, gradient-based inversion. Gradients are computed using the adjoint method, which requires one forward wavefield simulation and one adjoint wavefield simulation per earthquake used in the project.</p>

<p>The inversion was carried out over several frequency bands, starting with the longest periods and including a progressively broader frequency band. Within each frequency band, ~10-20 iterations were carried out, totalling to a hundred iterations. Synthetic seismograms and iteration information are stored for a subset of iterations, notably those where human interaction (i.e. the selection of events / data windows) took place.</p>

<p>Here, we describe:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The contents of this package</li>
	<li>How to set up the package such that all the data can be accessed and used, and reproduce the figures.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contents of this package</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Data that was used for the seismic waveform inversion: raw and processed seismograms, station information, earthquake information, as well as the window selection (designating the parts of the data that were actually used at each stage in the inversion) and synthetic seismograms produced during various stages of the inversion. This information is gathered in the LASIF project &quot;EMed_full.complete.tar&quot;.</li>
	<li>Models and misfit development across the iterations, as well as models relating to model testing, as carried out after the inversion. This information is gathered in the tarball &quot;MODEL_FILES.tar&quot;. Model files are both given in the ses3d ascii format (text file drho, dvsv, dvsh, dvp and block_x, block_y,&nbsp; block_z) and in bundled .vtu format. Conversion to .vtu was done using the tools in SCRIPTS. These vtu files can be viewed using Paraview.</li>
	<li>information on the tools and code that was used to do the inversion:
	<ul>
		<li>ses3d: a seismic wave propagation spectral element code in spherical coordinates. This will run both forward and adjoint simulations. This is available publicly through the developers on <a href=""https://cos.ethz.ch/software/production/ses3d.html"">https://cos.ethz.ch/software/production/ses3d.html</a>. See Gokhberg &amp; Fichtner, 2016.</li>
		<li>LASIF: a waveform inversion workflow managing package, where we have made small adaptations to make it suitable for our workflow. The original package is available via <a href=""http://www.lasif.net"">www.lasif.net</a> and on github (see Krischer et al, 2015), the modified version is added to this package as &#39;LASIF-master.zip&#39;.</li>
		<li>LASIF_scripts: bespoke scripts in order to interact with the LASIF project and generate different types of analyses and plots that are used in the publication. This is included in the tarball &#39;LASIF_scripts.tar&#39;</li>
		<li>SCRIPTS: containing some modified tools that were originally written for ses3d, as well as some additional tools - notably to interact with models converted to the VTK format. This is included in the tarball &#39;SCRIPTS.tar&#39;</li>
		<li>A description of the conda environment named lasif_ext (which is used for all the data analysis), in the form of the yml file &#39;lasif_ext.yml&#39;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>An additional LASIF project which is used just to compute sensitivity kernels for different windows within the same trace: &#39;EMed_window_kernels.tar&#39;. This is used as an example in one of the manuscript figures.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to set up the data package</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Download the entire data package. We will assume it is located in `~/Downloads/`.</li>
	<li>Get miniconda or anaconda if you don&#39;t have it.</li>
	<li>Install LASIF. This can be done using the instructions from the <a href=""http://lasif.net"">LASIF website</a>, but with a few adaptations, which are detailed in the lasif_ext.yml file. This amounts to the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Add the channel conda-forge to your standard channels</li>
		<li>Name the environment &quot;lasif_ext&quot;</li>
		<li>Manually replace the files in the LASIF source directory with those in LASIF-master.zip.</li>
		<li>Install the specific version of pyqt=4.11.</li>
		<li>Install the additional packages jupyter, vtk=7.0.0, pandas=0.23.4 (these are the ones that work for me).</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Extract the LASIF_scripts.tar to the site-packages directory of your conda environment:
	<pre><code class=""language-bash"">tar -xf ~/Downloads/LASIF_scripts.tar -C [/path/to/conda/environments]/lasif_ext/lib/python2.7/site-packages/</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>Make a project directory and extract all needed packages into it:
	<pre><code class=""language-bash""># make project directory
mkdir CEMed_project_Blometal
cd CEMed_project_Blometal

# extract data tarballs into it
tar -xf ~/Downloads/EMed_full.complete.tar
tar -xf ~/Downloads/EMed_window_kernels.tar
tar -xf ~/Downloads/MODEL_FILES.tar

# make scripts directory and extract scripts into it
mkdir conda_stuff
tar -xf ~/Downloads/SCRIPTS.tar -C conda_stuff

# make data analysis directory
mkdir data_analysis
cd data_analysis

# extract analysis tools
tar -xf ~/Downloads/NPY_FILES.tar
tar -xf ~/Downloads/FIGURE_SCRIPTS.tar
tar -xf ~/Downloads/figs_png.tar</code></pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the project should be ready for inspection. The following things can be done, for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reproduce the figures in the manuscript. All scripts for this are located in CEMed_project_Blometal/data_analysis/FIGURE_SCRIPTS/.
	<pre><code class=""language-bash"">conda activate lasif_ext
cd CEMed_project_Blometal
jupyter notebook</code></pre>

	<p>This should open up a browser tab that shows the directory structure. Navigate to data_analysis/FIGURE_scripts and click on one of the .ipynb files to open it. If you press &#39;Kernel&#39; &gt; &#39;Restart kernel and run all&#39; at the top, all cells will be launched automatically. This should work out of the box.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Interact with the lasif project. For this, refer to the <a href=""http://www.lasif.net"">LASIF website</a>. Note that above jupyter notebooks do so extensively, using the lasif communicator.</li>
	<li>Build additional analysis tools, using the tools supplied in SCRIPTS and LASIF_scripts.</li>

10.5061/dryad.66t1g1jzz,open,Data related to: The recurring role of storm disturbance on black sea bass (Centropristis striata) movement behaviors in the Mid-Atlantic Bight,"<p>Summer storm events are a significant source of disturbance in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) that cause rapid destratification of the water column.  Storm-driven mixing can be considered as a summertime disturbance regime to demersal communities, characterized by the recurrence of large changes in bottom water temperatures.  Black sea bass are a model ubiquitous demersal species in the MAB, as their sedentary behavior exposes them to summer storm disturbances and the physiological stresses associated with thermal destratification.  To better understand the responsiveness of black sea bass to storm impacts, we coupled biotelemetry with a high resolution Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM).  During the summers of 2016-2018, 8-15 black sea bass were released with acoustic transponders at each of three reef sites, which were surrounded by data-logging receivers.  Data were analyzed for activity levels, reef departures, and fluctuations in temperature, current velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy.  Movement rates were depressed with each consecutive passing storm, and late-season storms were associated with permanent evacuations. Consecutive, compounding increases in bottom temperature associated with repeated storm events were identified as the primary depressor of local movement. Storm-driven increases in turbulent kinetic energy and current velocity had comparatively smaller, albeit significant, effect. The need to better understand the effect of storms on fish populations in the MAB is relevant in understanding both coincident anthropogenic impacts as well as future fisheries management.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.h4f7p,open,Data from: Extracting spatio-temporal patterns in animal trajectories: an ecological application of sequence analysis methods,"Digital tracking technologies have considerably increased the amount and quality of animal trajectories, enabling the study of habitat use and habitat selection at a fine spatial and temporal scale. However, current approaches do not yet explicitly account for a key aspect of habitat use, namely the sequential variation in the use of different habitat features.  To overcome this limitation, we propose a tree-based approach that makes use of sequence analysis methods, derived from molecular biology, to explore and identify ecologically relevant sequential patterns in habitat use by animals. We applied this approach to ecological data consisting of simulated and real trajectories from a roe deer population (Capreolus capreolus), expressed as ordered sequences of habitat use.  We show that our approach effectively captured spatio-temporal patterns of sequential habitat use by roe deer. In our case study, individual sequences were clustered according to the sequential use of the elevation gradient (first order) and of open/closed habitats (second order). We provided evidence for several behavioural processes, such as migration and daily alternating habitat use. Some unexpected patterns, such as homogeneous sequences of use of open habitat, could also be identified.  Our findings advocate the importance of dealing with the sequential nature of movement data. Approaches based on sequence analysis methods are particularly useful and effective since they allow exploring temporal patterns of habitat use in a synthetic and visually captive manner. The proposed approach represents a useful and effective way to classify individual movement behaviour across populations and species. Ultimately, this method can be applied to explore the temporal scale of ecological processes based on movement."
10.5061/dryad.7jf0vp5,open,"Data from: The dynamics of open populations: integration of top–down, bottom–up and supply‐side influences on intertidal oysters","Most communities are structured not by a single process but by some combination of top–down, bottom–up and supply‐side (i.e. juvenile recruitment) factors. However, establishing how multiple processes interact remains a fundamental challenge. For example, the recruitment, growth, and mortality of estuarine species can vary along the steep and numerous environmental and biological gradients typical of these habitats, but the relative importance of those gradients is generally unknown. We took a novel approach to this question by coupling long‐term field observations of the Olympia oyster Ostrea lurida in a central California estuary with a state‐space integral projection model. This approach revealed that the most parsimonious description of oyster population dynamics involved spatial variation in growth and adult mortality – but not juvenile mortality – as well as spatiotemporal variation in recruitment. These patterns match the available short‐term estimates of each of those processes from field studies, and reveal a synthetic view of oyster population dynamics. Larval recruitment has an interannual 'boom and bust' pattern, and during good recruitment years most larvae settle in the inner bay where water residence time is highest. Adult oyster mortality is also highest in the inner bay, where several invasive predators are abundant and lowest in the mid‐bay, where oyster growth is greatest (due to bottom–up factors), likely leading to a size refuge from native predators. Surprisingly, juvenile mortality was constant across the bay, possibly because of a lack of size refuge from native and invasive predators. Our research approach represents an important advance in disentangling the contributions of spatio–temporal variation in top–down, bottom–up and supply‐side forces to the dynamics of populations with open recruitment."

10.5061/dryad.8tm76,open,Data from: Genealogical working distributions for Bayesian model testing with phylogenetic uncertainty,"Marginal likelihood estimates to compare models using Bayes factors frequently accompany Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Approaches to estimate marginal likelihoods have garnered increased attention over the past decade. In particular, the introduction of path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) into Bayesian phylogenetics has tremendously improved the accuracy of model selection. These sampling techniques are now used to evaluate complex evolutionary and population genetic models on empirical data sets, but considerable computational demands hamper their widespread adoption. Further, when very diffuse, but proper priors are specified for model parameters, numerical issues complicate the exploration of the priors, a necessary step in marginal likelihood estimation using PS or SS. To avoid such instabilities, generalized SS (GSS) has recently been proposed, introducing the concept of ""working distributions"" to facilitate - or shorten - the integration process that underlies marginal likelihood estimation. However, the need to fix the tree topology currently limits GSS in a coalescent-based framework. Here, we extend GSS by relaxing the fixed underlying tree topology assumption. To this purpose, we introduce a ""working"" distribution on the space of genealogies, that enables estimating marginal likelihoods while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. We propose two different ""working"" distributions that help GSS to outperform PS and SS in terms of accuracy when comparing demographic and evolutionary models applied to synthetic data and real-world examples. Further, we show that the use of very diffuse priors can lead to a considerable overestimation in marginal likelihood when using PS and SS, while still retrieving the correct marginal likelihood using both GSS approaches. The methods used in this paper are available in BEAST, a powerful user-friendly software package to perform Bayesian evolutionary analyses."
10.5061/dryad.cnp5hqc19,open,"Relationships among wood-boring beetles, fungal endophytes and saprotrophs, and the decomposition of forest biomass.","<p>A prevailing paradigm in forest ecology is that wood-boring beetles facilitate wood decay and carbon cycling, but empirical tests have yielded mixed results. We experimentally determined the effects of wood borers on fungal community assembly and wood decay within pine trunks in the southeastern United States. Pine trunks were made either beetle-accessible or inaccessible. Fungal communities were compared using culturing and high-throughput meta-barcode sequencing of DNA and RNA. Prior to beetle infestation, living pines had diverse fungal endophyte communities. Endophytes were displaced by beetle-associated fungi in beetle-accessible trees, whereas some endophytes persisted as saprotrophs in beetle-excluded trees. Beetles increased fungal diversity several fold. Over forty taxa of Ascomycota were significantly associated with beetles, but beetles were not consistently associated with any known wood-decaying fungi. Instead, increasing ambrosia beetle infestations caused reduced decay, consistent with previous in vitro experiments that showed beetle-associated fungi reduce decay rates by competing with decay fungi. No effect of bark-inhabiting beetles on decay was detected. Platypodines carried significantly more fungal taxa than scolytines. Molecular results were validated by synthetic and biological mock communities and were consistent across methodologies. RNA sequencing confirmed that beetle-associated fungi were biologically active in the wood. Meta-barcode sequencing of the LSU/28S marker recovered important fungal symbionts that were missed by ITS2, though community-level effects were similar between markers. In contrast to the current forest ecology paradigm, our results indicate ambrosia beetles introduce diverse fungal communities that do not extensively decay wood, but instead reduce decay by competing with wood decay fungi.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.3719059,open,Logical model for Model checking to assess T-helper cell plasticity,"<p>Logical modeling has proven suitable for the dynamical analysis of large signaling and transcriptional regulatory networks. In this context, signaling input components are generally meant to convey external stimuli, or environmental cues. In response to such external signals, cells acquire specific gene expression patterns modeled in terms of attractors (e.g. stable states). The capacity for cells to alter or reprogram their differentiated states upon changes in environmental conditions is referred to as cell plasticity.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2014.00086"">[1]</a>, it is presented an extended version of a published logical model of T-helper cell differentiation and plasticity, which accounts for novel cellular subtypes. The model encompasses 20 signaling pathways, a dozen of transcription factors, and about 30 cytokines, amounting to 101 components in total.</p>

<p>Computational methods recently developed to efficiently analyze large models <a href=""http://ginsim.org/node/185#ref1"">[1]</a> are first used to study static properties of the model (i.e. stables states). Symbolic model checking is then applied to get further insights into reachability properties between Th canonical subtypes upon changes of specific prototypic environmental cues.</p>

<p>The model reproduces novel reported Th subtypes (Tfh, Th9, Th22) and predicts additional Th hybrid subtypes in term of stables states. Using the model checker NuSMV-ARCTL, an abstract view of the dynamics, called reprograming graph, is produced providing a global and synthetic view of Th plasticity. The model is consistent with experimental data showing the polarization of na&iuml;ve Th cells into the canonical Th subtypes. The model further predicts substancial plasticity of Th subtypes depending on the signalling environment.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.73s0n,open,"Data from: Climate, demography, and zoogeography predict introgression thresholds in Salmonid hybrid zones in Rocky Mountain streams","Among the many threats posed by invasions of nonnative species is introgressive hybridization, which can lead to the genomic extinction of native taxa. This phenomenon is regarded as common and perhaps inevitable among native cutthroat trout and introduced rainbow trout in western North America, despite that these taxa naturally co-occur in some locations. We conducted a synthetic analysis of 13,315 genotyped fish from 558 sites by building logistic regression models using data from geospatial stream databases and from 12 published studies of hybridization to assess whether environmental covariates could explain levels of introgression between westslope cutthroat trout and rainbow trout in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains. A consensus model performed well (AUC, 0.78–0.86; classification success, 72–82%; 10-fold cross validation, 70–82%) and predicted that rainbow trout introgression was significantly associated with warmer water temperatures, larger streams, proximity to warmer habitats and to recent sources of rainbow trout propagules, presence within the historical range of rainbow trout, and locations further east. Assuming that water temperatures will continue to rise in response to climate change and that levels of introgression outside the historical range of rainbow trout will equilibrate with those inside that range, we applied six scenarios across a 55,234-km stream network that forecast 9.5–74.7% declines in the amount of habitat occupied by westslope cutthroat trout populations of conservation value, but not the wholesale loss of such populations. We conclude that introgression between these taxa is predictably related to environmental conditions, many of which can be manipulated to foster largely genetically intact populations of westslope cutthroat trout and help managers prioritize conservation activities."

(2020) &#39;Volcano growth versus deformation by strike-slip faults: morphometric characterization through analogue modelling&#39;, published in Tectonophysics (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2020.228411). The data set consists of (1) 249 digital elevation models (DEMs) of each step of the the analogue experiments carried out, in standard ENVI format, zipped; and (2) an Excel file containing the DEM-derived morphometric parameters for each of the analogue models.</p>

<p>Experiments were carried out at the analogue modelling lab of the Department of Geography at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium). A granular mixture of fine-grained quartz sand and kaolin clay was used as analogue material. Experiments were conducted on a fixed table, on which a basal layer of granular material was placed. A basal plate attached to a step-motor was used to simulate pure strike-slip displacements of the basal layer. Volcano growth was simulated by depositing loads of granular material on top of the basal layer from a point source. The analogue models were photographed at regular time intervals during the experiments using four digital cameras. The photographs were used to generate synthetic digital elevation models (DEMs) with 0.2 mm spatial resolution of each step of the analogue models by applying the MICMAC digital stereo-photogrammetry software. The ENVI software was used to re-sample the DEMs to a 0.5 mm spatial resolution and apply the noise-reduction Lee filter. Morphometric data were then extracted from the DEMs by applying two IDL-language algorithms: NETVOLC, used to automatically calculate the volcano edifice basal outline, and MORVOLC, used to extract a set of morphometric parameters.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.qd53c,open,Data from: Shaping the latitudinal diversity gradient: New perspectives from a synthesis of paleobiology and biogeography,"An impediment to understanding the origin and dynamics of the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) -- the most pervasive large-scale biotic pattern on Earth -- has been the tendency to focus narrowly on a single causal factor, when a more synthetic, integrative approach is needed. Using marine bivalves as a model system, and drawing on other systems where possible, we review paleobiologic and biogeographic support for two supposedly opposing views, that the LDG is shaped primarily by (a) local environmental factors that determine the number of species and higher taxa at a given latitude (in-situ hypotheses), or (b) the entry of lineages arising elsewhere into a focal region (spatial-dynamics hypotheses). Support for (a) includes the fit of present-day diversity trends in many clades to environmental factors such as temperature, and the correlation of extinction intensities in Pliocene bivalve faunas with net regional temperature changes. Support for (b) includes the age-frequency distribution of bivalve genera across latitudes, which is consistent with an out-of-the-tropics dynamic, as are the higher species diversities in temperate southeast Australia and southern Japan than in the tropical Caribbean. Thus, both in-situ and spatial-dynamics processes must shape the bivalve LDG, and are likely to operate in other groups as well. The relative strengths of the two processes may differ among groups showing similar LDGs, but dissecting their effects will require improved methods of integrating fossil data with molecular phylogenies. We highlight several potential research directions, and argue that many of the most dramatic biotic patterns, past and present, are likely to have been generated by diverse, mutually reinforcing drivers."
10.5061/dryad.s1rn8pk3j,open,Predator pheromone elicits a temporally dependent non-consumptive effect in prey,"<ol>
	<li>The influence of predator cues on the behaviour of prey is well supported in the literature; however, a clear understanding of how predator cues affect prey in variable environmental conditions and over longer time scales is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms. Here, we measure how predator odors affect herbivore colonization, abundance, oviposition, and plant damage across two growing seasons.</li>
	<li>The study system consisted of <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata </i> (Colorado potato beetle) as prey, and the aggregation pheromone of live <i>Podisus maculiventris </i> (spined soldier bug) as the predator cue in a potato field.</li>
	<li>In 2016, the amount of feeding damage by early beetle colonists was lower in predator odor‐treated plots, reducing plant damage by 22%. Larval abundance was also reduced in treated plots in 2016. Beetle abundance and damage in 2017 was similar in the treatment and control plots. Two mechanisms were investigated to better understand why prey response to the predator odor treatment weakened over the first season, including changes in predator odor cue strength and prey habituation. Predator odor cue strength emerged as a likely explanation, as dispensers, which released a synthetic predator pheromone over the entire season, reduced the probability of finding damage more consistently than the live predator treatment.</li>
	<li>These results suggest that temporal patterns of predator cue release and strength may drive prey response across the season, underscoring the importance of cue release‐rate and consistency in both species interactions and for the future application of modifying insect behaviour using non‐consumptive effects in agricultural systems.</li>

Afterwards, P(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) was explored for use as a dispersant in coal water slurry (CWS) preparation. The structure of P(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) was verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The synthetic conditions were optimized as the feed ratio of AA to SS was 1:1 (for Yulin coal) or 1.5:1 (for Yili coal), and DMDAAC dosage was 4.0 wt% (for Yulin coal) and 6.0 wt% (for Yili coal) toward total monomers. The performances of P(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) as a dispersant for CWS were evaluated by various technologies, such as apparent viscosity, Zeta potential, static stability and contact angle measurements. The results revealed that the optimized dosage of P(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) in CWS preparation was 0.3 wt% and 0.4 wt% for Yulin coal and Yili coal respectively. In this optimum condition, CWS prepared using P(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) as dispersant showed a typical shear thinning behavior and excellent stability, which are desired in industry. The rheological models also confirmed the pseudo-plastic characteristics of CWS. Finally, as compared to the widespread used anionic dispersant Poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), P(SS-co-AA-co-DMDAAC) developed in this work exhibited better slurry making performance. Introduction of cationic functional groups promoted the adsorption of dispersant, which further enhanced the electrostatic repulsion among coal particles. Accordingly, the viscosity of CWS decreased and static stability enhanced.</p>"

However, their unbiased detection and analysis remain hindered by technical limitations. Here, we present a spectral alignment method for the identification of protein modifications from high-resolution tandem peptide mass spectrometry. Termed SAMPEI for Spectral Alignment-based Modified PEptide Identification, this open-source algorithm is designed for the discovery of functional protein and peptide signaling modifications, without prior knowledge of their identities. Using synthetic standards and controlled chemical labeling experiments, we demonstrate specificity and sensitivity of SAMPEI for the discovery of protein modifications in complex cellular extracts. We then apply SAMPEI to mapping chemical protein modifications in differentiating mouse macrophage proteome. SAMPEI revealed diverse post-translational protein modifications, including distinct forms of cysteine itaconatylation which we experimentally validated. SAMPEI&rsquo;s robust parameterization and versatility are expected to facilitate the discovery of biological modifications of diverse macromolecules.

10.5061/dryad.g0v02,open,"Data from: A new integrative framework for large-scale assessments of biodiversity and community dynamics, using littoral gastropods and crabs of British Columbia, Canada","Improving our understanding of species responses to environmental changes is an important contribution ecologists can make to facilitate effective management decisions. Novel synthetic approaches to assessing biodiversity and ecosystem integrity are needed, ideally including all species living in a community and the dynamics defining their ecological relationships. Here we present and apply an integrative approach that links high-throughput, multi-character taxonomy with community ecology. The overall purpose is to enable the coupling of biodiversity assessments with investigations into the nature of ecological interactions in a community-level data set. We collected 1,195 gastropods and crabs in British Columbia. First, the General mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) and the Poisson Tree Processes (PTP) methods for proposing primary species-hypotheses based on cox1 sequences were evaluated against an integrative taxonomic framework. We then used data on the geographic distribution of delineated species to test species co-occurrence patterns for non-randomness using community-wide and pairwise approaches. Results showed that PTP generally outperformed GMYC and thus constitutes a more effective option for producing species-hypotheses in community-level datasets. Non-random species co-occurrence patterns indicative of ecological relationships or habitat preferences were observed for grazer gastropods, whereas assemblages of opportunistic omnivorous gastropods and crabs appeared influenced by random processes. Species-pair associations were consistent with current ecological knowledge, thus suggesting that applying community assembly within a large taxonomical framework constitutes a valuable tool for assessing ecological interactions. Combining phylogenetic, morphological and co-occurrence data enabled an integrated view of communities, providing both a conceptual and pragmatic framework for biodiversity assessments and investigations into community dynamics."
10.5061/dryad.4b8gtht82,open,Spectral-ratio tomography for attenuation estimation,"<p>In the measurement of surface seismic data, an accurate attenuation-estimation method is necessary to compensate for the energy loss and phase distortion of seismic waves, and also beneficial for further quantitative amplitude analyses and reservoir parameters prediction. We design a more accurate Q tomography method to estimate Q values. This method inverts for the Q values in the overburden and target layer simultaneously without assumptions on the overburden, which allows us to separate the overburden effect during the inversion. As Q tomography methods estimate Q value by assuming the source wavelet is known, the results of Q value are often affected by the errors of the calculated source wavelet. Thus, from the same source, we take the spectral ratio of two reflections from the top and bottom of a target layer as an alternative for tomography input. For the log spectral ratio (LSR) method and attenuated traveltime tomography (t* tomography), picking two reflections at different traveltimes may be affected in different ways by lateral changes in the overburden (we call it the overburden effect). Thus, the accuracy of the conventional methods may be affected by differences between the ray paths in the overburden of the two picked reflections. In our method, we address this problem using an inversion method, which allows us to separate attenuation effects from the overburden by using traveltime difference in the tomography grid cells. Q values of the target layer and that of the overburden can be inverted simultaneously. We test the method in synthetic data and prove its feasibility and effectiveness by applying it to field data.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.h13vg,open,Data from: Patterns and drivers of intraspecific variation in avian life history along elevational gradients: a meta-analysis,"Elevational gradients provide powerful natural systems for testing hypotheses regarding the role of environmental variation in the evolution of life-history strategies. Case studies have revealed shifts towards slower life histories in organisms living at high elevations yet no synthetic analyses exist of elevational variation in life-history traits for major vertebrate clades. We examined (i) how life-history traits change with elevation in paired populations of bird species worldwide, and (ii) which biotic and abiotic factors drive elevational shifts in life history. Using three analytical methods, we found that fecundity declined at higher elevations due to smaller clutches and fewer reproductive attempts per year. By contrast, elevational differences in traits associated with parental investment or survival varied among studies. High-elevation populations had shorter and later breeding seasons, but longer developmental periods implying that temporal constraints contribute to reduced fecundity. Analyses of clutch size data, the trait for which we had the largest number of population comparisons, indicated no evidence that phylogenetic history constrained species-level plasticity in trait variation associated with elevational gradients. The magnitude of elevational shifts in life-history traits were largely unrelated to geographic (altitude, latitude), intrinsic (body mass, migratory status), or habitat covariates. Meta-population structure, methodological issues associated with estimating survival, or processes shaping range boundaries could potentially explain the nature of elevational shifts in life-history traits evident in this data set. We identify a new risk factor for montane populations in changing climates: low fecundity will result in lower reproductive potential to recover from perturbations, especially as fewer than half of the species experienced higher survival at higher elevations."
10.5061/dryad.112dg,open,Data from: The Teleost Anatomy Ontology: anatomical representation for the genomics age,"The rich knowledge of morphological variation among organisms reported in the systematic literature has remained in free-text format, impractical for use in large-scale synthetic phylogenetic work. This noncomputable format has also precluded linkage to the large knowledgebase of genomic, genetic, developmental, and phenotype data in model organism databases. We have undertaken an effort to prototype a curated, ontology-based evolutionary morphology database that maps to these genetic databases (http://kb.phenoscape.org) to facilitate investigation into the mechanistic basis and evolution of phenotypic diversity. Among the first requirements in establishing this database was the development of a multispecies anatomy ontology with the goal of capturing anatomical data in a systematic and computable manner. An ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts with defined relationships between those concepts. Multispecies anatomy ontologies in particular are an efficient way to represent the diversity of morphological structures in a clade of organisms, but they present challenges in their development relative to single-species anatomy ontologies. Here, we describe the Teleost Anatomy Ontology (TAO), a multispecies anatomy ontology for teleost fishes derived from the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology (ZFA) for the purpose of annotating varying morphological features across species. To facilitate interoperability with other anatomy ontologies, TAO uses the Common Anatomy Reference Ontology as a template for its upper level nodes, and TAO and ZFA are synchronized, with zebrafish terms specified as subtypes of teleost terms. We found that the details of ontology architecture have ramifications for querying, and we present general challenges in developing a multispecies anatomy ontology, including refinement of definitions, taxon-specific relationships among terms, and representation of taxonomically variable developmental pathways."

Innovative approaches to control <i>Aedes</i> populations, involving synthetic transgenic modifications as well as <i>Wolbachia</i> bacteria, appear promising. For the various techniques requiring offspring inheritance of a trait, released males must successfully compete for mating partners against wildtype males. However, very little is known about mechanisms of mate selection in mosquitoes in general and in particular about potential correlations between mating success and offspring immune performance. Harmonic convergence signals have been proposed as a cue for females to predict male quality. We investigated whether offspring of converging parental pairs showed differences in immune competence compared to offspring derived from non-converging parental pairs using three different types of immune assays. We found that offspring immune responses (melanization response and response to a bacterial challenge) differed between offspring from converging and non-converging parents. However, immune responses were shaped by several interacting factors such as sex, age, reproductive status, and parental mating behavior. Parental mating behavior had a stronger effect on the immune response of male offspring than on female offspring. Further, a population of female offspring derived from converging parental pairs reached their peak dengue virus dissemination rate earlier compared to a population of offspring derived from non-converging parental pairs. Our results provide insight into a wide range of selective pressures shaping mosquito immune function. Evolutionary trade-offs between naturally and sexually selected traits can have important implications for disease transmission and control and should be considered in the development of reproductive control strategies.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.573n5tb8x,open,Scores from S.invicta queen supergene pheromone discrimination assays,"<p>Ants use chemical signals to communicate for various purposes related to colony function. Social organization in the red imported fire ant, <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>, is determined by the <i>Sb</i> supergene, with colonies of the monogyne (single-queen) form lacking the element and colonies of the polygyne (multiple-queen) form possessing it. Polygyne workers accept new reproductive queens in their nest, but only those carrying <i>Sb</i>; young winged queens lacking this genetic element are executed as they mature sexually in their natal nest or as they attempt to enter a foreign nest to initiate reproduction after mating and shedding their wings. It has been suggested that queen supergene genotype status is signaled to workers by unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons, while queen reproductive status is signaled by piperidines (venom alkaloids). We used high-throughput behavioral assays to study worker acceptance of paper dummies dosed with fractions of extracts of polygyne queens, or blends of synthetic counterparts of queen cuticular compounds. We show that the queen supergene pheromone comprises a blend of monoene and diene unsaturated hydrocarbons. Our assays also reveal that unsaturated hydrocarbons elicit discrimination by polygyne workers only when associated with additional compounds that signal queen fertility. This synergistic effect was obtained with a polar fraction of queen extracts, but not by the piperidine alkaloids, suggesting that the chemical(s) indicating queen reproductive status are compounds more polar than cuticular hydrocarbons but are not the piperidine alkaloids. Our results advance understanding of the role of chemical signaling that is central to the regulation of social organization in an important invasive pest and model ant species.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.h1d1b,open,"Data from: Causes of ecological gradients in leaf margin entirety: Evaluating the roles of biomechanics, hydraulics, vein geometry, and bud packing","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: A recent commentary by Edwards et al. (Am. J. Bot. 103: 975–978) proposed that constraints imposed by the packing of young leaves in buds could explain the positive association between non-entire leaf margins and latitude but did not thoroughly consider alternative explanations. METHODS: We review the logic and evidence underlying six major hypotheses for the functional significance of marginal teeth, involving putative effects on (1) leaf cooling, (2) optimal support and supply of the areas served by major veins, (3) enhanced leaf-margin photosynthesis, (4) hydathodal function, (5) defense against herbivores, and (6) bud packing. KEY RESULTS: Theoretical and empirical problems undermine all hypotheses except the support–supply hypothesis, which implies that thinner leaves should have non-entire margins. Phylogenetically structured analyses across angiosperms, the El Yunque flora, and the genus Viburnum all demonstrate that non-entire margins are indeed more common in thinner leaves. Across angiosperms, the association of leaf thickness with non-entire leaf margins is stronger than that of latitude. CONCLUSION: We outline a synthetic model showing how biomechanics, hydraulics, vein geometry, rates of leaf expansion, and length of development within resting buds, all tied to leaf thickness, drive patterns in the distribution of entire vs. non-entire leaf margins. Our model accounts for dominance of entire margins in the tropics, Mediterranean scrub, and tundra, non-entire margins in cold temperate deciduous forests and tropical vines and early-successional trees, and entire leaf margins in monocots. Spinose-toothed leaves should be favored in short-statured evergreen trees and shrubs, primarily in Mediterranean scrub and related semiarid habitats."

<strong>Paper abstract</strong>:&nbsp;Modern visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) are faced with a critical challenge in real-world deployment: they need to operate reliably and robustly in highly dynamic environments. Current best solutions merely filter dynamic objects as outliers based on the semantics of the object category. Such an approach does not scale as it requires semantic classifiers to encompass all possibly-moving object classes; this is hard to define, let alone deploy. On the other hand, many real-world environments exhibit strong structural regularities in the form of planes such as walls and ground surfaces, which are also crucially static. We present RP-VIO, a monocular visual-inertial odometry system that leverages the simple geometry of these planes for improved robustness and accuracy in challenging dynamic environments. Since existing datasets have a limited number of dynamic elements, we also present a highly-dynamic, photorealistic synthetic dataset for a more effective evaluation of the capabilities of modern VINS systems. We evaluate our approach on this dataset, and three diverse sequences from standard datasets including two real-world dynamic sequences and show a significant improvement in robustness and accuracy over a state-of-the-art monocular visual-inertial odometry system. We also show in simulation an improvement over a simple dynamic-features masking approach. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p>"

<p>Each file in the collection has a name where there is indicated the location from where the search has been done, the userID, and the searched product: &nbsp; <em>no_email_LOCATION_USERID.PRODUCT.shopping_testing.#.html</em></p>

<p>The locations&nbsp; are Philippines (PHI), United States (US), India (IN). The userIDs: 26 to 30 for users searching from Philippines, 1 to 5 from US, 11 to 15 from India.</p>

<p>Products have been choice following 130 keywords (e.g., MP3 player, MP4 Watch, Personal organizer, Television, etc.).</p>

<p>In the following, we describe how the search results have been collected.</p>

<p>Each user has a fresh profile. The creation of a new profile corresponds to launch a new, isolated, web browser client instance and open the Google Shopping&nbsp;US web page.</p>

<p>To mimic real users, the synthetic users can browse, scroll pages, stay on a&nbsp; page, and click on links.</p>

<p>A fully-fledged web browser is used to get the correct desktop version of the website under investigation. This is because websites could be designed to behave according to user agents, as witnessed by the differences between the mobile and desktop versions of the same website.</p>

<p>The prices are the retail ones displayed by Google Shopping in US dollars (thus, excluding shipping fees).</p>

<p>Several frameworks have been proposed for interacting with web browsers and analysing results from search engines. This research adopts OpenWPM. OpenWPM is automatised with <a href=""http://www.seleniumhq.org/"">Selenium</a>&nbsp;to efficiently create and manage&nbsp;different users with isolated Firefox and Chrome client instances, each of them with their own associated cookies.</p>

<p>The experiments run, on average, 24 hours. In each of them, the software runs on our local server, but the browser&#39;s traffic is redirected to the designated&nbsp;remote servers (i.e., to India), via tunneling in SOCKS proxies. This way, all commands are simultaneously distributed over all proxies. The experiments adopt the Mozilla Firefox browser (version 45.0) for&nbsp; the web browsing tasks and run&nbsp; under Ubuntu 14.04. Also, for each query,&nbsp; we consider the first page of results, counting 40 products. Among them, the focus of the experiments is mostly on the top 10 and top 3 results.</p>

<p>Due to connection errors, one of the Philippine profiles have no associated results. Also, for Philippines, a few keywords did not lead to any results: videocassette recorders, totes, umbrellas. Similarly, for US,&nbsp; no results were for totes and umbrellas.</p>

<p>The search results have been analyzed in order to check if there were evidence of price steering, based on users&#39; location.</p>

10.5061/dryad.7338sk6,open,Data from: Linking species abundance and overyielding from experimental communities with niche and fitness characteristics,"1)	So far, the principal force shaping local plant abundance patterns remains unclear. Rarity can result from poor competitive ability or from small vegetative or generative reproduction, but also from strong self-limitation. The same mechanisms can drive species-specific overyielding, i.e. increased species productivity at high community diversity. Rare species can then benefit more (i.e. overyield to a larger extent) from growing in species-rich communities because of altered competitive hierarchies or smaller conspecific frequencies. Here we test which mechanism is the most important determinant of species rarity and of species-specific productivity across a diversity gradient ranging from one- to 60-species plots.
2)	For that we measured vegetative growth, competitive ability (competitive effect), and negative frequency dependence for 49 perennial grassland species from Central Europe. We then linked these characteristics with species abundance (measured as species biomass from 60-species plots) and with species-specific overyielding in The Jena Experiment.
3)	Species with higher rates of vegetative growth (when grown without neighbors) were also more abundant in the Jena Experiment. Larger species-specific overyielding was then associated with a stronger negative frequency dependence. As species with greater vegetative growth were also more self-limited, larger overyielding in species-rich communities was characteristic for common rather than for rare species, refuting our initial hypothesis. Finally, path analysis indicated that species with poor capacity to suppress neighbors also profited more from growing in diverse communities.
4)	Synthesis. Our results identify key mechanisms driving abundance and productivity of species in synthetic communities differing in species richness. While vegetative reproduction was closely associated with abundance, intraspecific interactions (strength of negative frequency dependence) shaped species productivity across a richness gradient. Our study sheds light on the abundance patterns of species and their influence on community functions, such as biomass production, of species-rich and -poor vegetation."
10.5061/dryad.hj8fr,open,"Data from: Seasonal cycles, phylogenetic assembly, and functional diversity of orchid bee communities","Neotropical rainforests sustain some of the most diverse terrestrial communities on Earth. Euglossine (or orchid) bees are a diverse lineage of insect pollinators distributed throughout the American tropics, where they provide pollination services to a staggering diversity of flowering plant taxa. Elucidating the seasonal patterns of phylogenetic assembly and functional trait diversity of bee communities can shed new light into the mechanisms that govern the assembly of bee pollinator communities and the potential effects of declining bee populations. Male euglossine bees collect, store, and accumulate odoriferous compounds (perfumes) to subsequently use during courtship display. Thus, synthetic chemical baits can be used to attract and monitor euglossine bee populations. We conducted monthly censuses of orchid bees in three sites in the Magdalena valley of Colombia – a region where Central and South American biotas converge – to investigate the structure, diversity, and assembly of euglossine bee communities through time in relation to seasonal climatic cycles. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that phylogenetic community structure and functional trait diversity changed in response to seasonal rainfall fluctuations. All communities exhibited strong to moderate phylogenetic clustering throughout the year, with few pronounced bursts of phylogenetic overdispersion that coincided with the transition from wet-to-dry seasons. Despite the heterogeneous distribution of functional traits (e.g., body size, body mass, and proboscis length) and the observed seasonal fluctuations in phylogenetic diversity, we found that functional trait diversity, evenness, and divergence remained constant during all seasons in all communities. However, similar to the pattern observed with phylogenetic diversity, functional trait richness fluctuated markedly with rainfall in all sites. These results emphasize the importance of considering seasonal fluctuations in community assembly and provide a glimpse to the potential effects that climatic alterations may have on both pollinator communities and the ecosystem services they provide."
10.5061/dryad.739bs,open,Data from: Comparison of methods for molecular species delimitation across a range of speciation scenarios,"Species are fundamental units in biological research and can be defined on the basis of various operational criteria. There has been growing use of molecular approaches for species delimitation. Among the most widely used methods, the generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) and Poisson tree processes (PTP) were designed for the analysis of single-locus data but are often applied to concatenations of multilocus data. In contrast, the Bayesian multispecies coalescent approach in the software BPP explicitly models the evolution of multilocus data. In this study, we compare the performance of GMYC, PTP, and BPP using synthetic data generated by simulation under various speciation scenarios. We show that in the absence of gene flow, the main factor influencing the performance of these methods is the ratio of population size to divergence time, while number of loci and sample size per species have smaller effects. Given appropriate priors and correct guide trees, BPP shows lower rates of species overestimation and underestimation, and is generally robust to various potential confounding factors except high levels of gene flow. The single-threshold GMYC and the best strategy that we identified in PTP generally perform well for scenarios involving more than a single putative species when gene flow is absent, but PTP outperforms GMYC when fewer species are involved. Both methods are more sensitive than BPP to the effects of gene flow and potential confounding factors. Case studies of bears and bees further validate some of the findings from our simulation study, and reveal the importance of using an informed starting point for molecular species delimitation. Our results highlight the key factors affecting the performance of molecular species delimitation, with potential benefits for using these methods within an integrative taxonomic framework."
10.5061/dryad.h6pf365t,open,Data from: Sharing and re-use of phylogenetic trees (and associated data) to facilitate synthesis,"BACKGROUND: Recently, various evolution-related journals adopted policies to encourage or require archiving of phylogenetic trees and associated data. Such attention to practices that promote data sharing reflects rapidly improving information technology, and rapidly expanding potential to use this technology to aggregate and link data from previously published research. Nevertheless, little is known about current practices, or best practices, for publishing phylogenetic trees and associated data in a way that promotes re-use. RESULTS: Here we summarize results of an ongoing analysis of current practices for archiving phylogenetic trees and associated data, current practices of re-use, and current barriers to re-use. We find that the technical infrastructure is available to support rudimentary archiving, but the frequency of archiving is low. Currently, most phylogenetic knowledge is not easily re-used due to a lack of archiving, lack of awareness of best practices, and lack of community-wide standards for formatting data, naming entities, and annotating data. Most attempts at data re-use seem to end in disappointment. Nevertheless, we find many positive examples of data re-use, particularly those that involve customized species trees generated by grafting to, and pruning from, a mega-tree. CONCLUSIONS: The technologies and practices that facilitate data re-use can catalyze synthetic and integrative research. However, success will require engagement from various stakeholders including individual scientists who produce or consume shareable data, publishers, policy-makers, technology developers and resource-providers. The critical challenges for facilitating re-use of phylogenetic trees and associated data, we suggest, include: a broader commitment to public archiving; more extensive use of globally meaningful identifiers; development of user-friendly technology for annotating, submitting, searching, and retrieving data and their metadata; and development of a minimum reporting standard (MIAPA) indicating which kinds of data and metadata are most important for a re-useable phylogenetic record."
10.5061/dryad.bnzs7h4bs,open,Analytical kinetic model of native tandem promoters in E. coli,"<p><span>Closely spaced promoters in tandem formation are abundant in bacteria. We investigated the evolutionary conservation, biological functions, and the RNA and single-cell protein expression of genes regulated by tandem promoters in <i>E. coli</i>. We also studied the sequence (distance between transcription start sites '<i>d<sub>TSS</sub>'</i>,<i> </i>pause sequences, and distances from oriC) and potential influence of the input transcription factors of these promoters. From this, we propose an analytical model of gene expression based on measured expression dynamics, where RNAP-promoter occupancy times and <i>d<sub>TSS</sub> </i>are the key regulators of transcription interference due to TSS occlusion by RNAP at one of the promoters (when <i>d<sub>TSS</sub> </i>≤ 35 bp) and RNAP occupancy of the downstream promoter (when <i>d<sub>TSS</sub> </i>&gt; 35 bp). Occlusion and downstream promoter occupancy are modeled as linear functions of occupancy time, while the influence of <i>d<sub>TSS</sub> i</i>s implemented by a continuous step function, fit to <i>in vivo</i> data on mean single-cell protein numbers of 30 natural genes controlled by tandem promoters. The best-fitting step is at 35 bp, matching the length of DNA occupied by RNAP in the open complex formation. This model accurately predicts the squared coefficient of variation and skewness of the natural single-cell protein numbers as a function of <i>d<sub>TSS</sub></i>. Additional predictions suggest that promoters in tandem formation can cover a wide range of transcription dynamics within realistic intervals of parameter values. By accurately capturing the dynamics of these promoters, this model can be helpful to predict the dynamics of new promoters and contribute to the expansion of the repertoire of expression dynamics available to synthetic genetic constructs.</span></p>"
10.5061/dryad.f79j433,open,Data from: A new approach to study local adaptation in long-lived organisms: virtual transplant experiments,"1. Despite the importance of local adaptation and the extended literature that has addressed it, there are few methods available to explore local adaptation across large temporal scales. However, long-term patterns are likely to be essential to understanding adaptation in long-lived species, such as trees. 2. Here, we propose a methodology named 'virtual transplant experiment' (VTE), which uses long-term climatic variability to explore local adaptation to climate in natural tree populations. VTEs evaluate the historical response of populations to their local climate and to climates representative of conditions in other populations. We tested our methodology using simulated data and applied it in two case studies on: (i) Pinus nigra populations at the edge of the species distribution, where previous research has suggested strong climate adaptation, and (ii) Fagus sylvatica mesic populations, where parallel experiments showed no adaptation to macroclimate. 3. VTE results from simulated and real-world data matched our expectations, suggesting that the method accurately identified the patterns of local adaptation to climate in tree populations. VTEs consistently discriminated locally adapted populations in synthetic data with a known degree of local adaptation. As expected, P. nigra populations showed adaptation to local climate in the VTE, while F. sylvatica populations showed no overall local advantage. 4. Our method provides a new way to test for local adaptation over time scales encompassing the complete lifespan of trees. VTEs can complement current methods to study local adaptation by adding the ability to explore the long-term response to local climate in natural populations. The advantages and limitations of the different approaches to studying local adaptation stress the importance of combining multiple approaches to test for local adaptation in long-lived organisms."

Please find the abstract below.</p>

<p>Catalyst development for biochemical cascade reactions often follows a &ldquo;whole cell approach&rdquo; in which a single microbial cell is made to express all of the required enzyme activities. Although attractive in principle, the approach can encounter limitations when efficient overall flux from substrate to product necessitates precise balancing between the individual activities. Here, we show effective integration of major design strategies from synthetic biology to a coherent development of plasmid vectors enabling tunable two‐enzyme co‐expression in&nbsp;<em>E. coli&nbsp;</em>, for the purpose of whole‐cell production of cellobiose. Flux efficiency in the transformation of sucrose and glucose into cellobiose by a parallel (countercurrent) cascade of disaccharide phosphorylases requires the enzyme co‐expression cope with large differences in the specific activity of cellobiose phosphorylase (14 U mg<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and sucrose phosphorylase (122 U mg<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Comparing mono‐ and bicistronic co‐expression strategies, we analyze genetic elements controlling transcription, transcription‐translation coupling or plasmid replication for effect on activity, and also stable producibility, of the whole cell catalyst. We discover a key role of the&nbsp;<em>bom&nbsp;</em>(basis of mobility) site for plasmid stability dependent on the origin of replication and demonstrate the importance of RBS (ribosome binding site) strength for balanced bicistronic co‐expression. Whole cell catalysts show high specific rates (460 &mu;mol cellobiose min<sup>&minus;1</sup>&nbsp;g<sup>&minus;1</sup>&nbsp;dry cells) and performance metrics (30 g L<sup>&minus;1</sup>; &sim;82% yield; 3.8 g L<sup>&minus;1</sup>&nbsp;h<sup>&minus;1</sup>&nbsp;overall productivity) promising for cellobiose production.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.3532894,open,Nonlinear imaging microscopy for assessing structural and photochemical modifications upon laser removal of dammar varnish on photosensitive substrates,"<p>The nonlinear optical microscopy (NLM) modalities of Multi-Photon Excited Fluorescence (MPEF) and Third Harmonic Generation (THG) have been combined in this work to characterize as a function of depth with micrometric resolution the type and extent of morphological and photochemical modifications that take place upon ultraviolet (UV) pulsed laser removal of a dammar varnish layer applied on a photosensitive substrate. The latter consists on a layer of the synthetic polymer polymethyl methacrylate doped with a photosensitizer, the aromatic compound 1,4-di[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)] benzene, that strongly fluoresces upon UV light illumination. A number of laser conditions for partial or total elimination of the varnish coating were explored, namely different wavelengths (266, 248 and 213 nm) and pulse durations, in the nanosecond, picosecond and femtosecond ranges. Changes in the MPEF signals upon laser ablation of the outermost varnish layer successfully signpost photochemical modifications of the varnish or of the photosensitive under-layer, and their dependence with the laser ablation parameters, i.e., wavelength and pulse duration. In turn, THG signals mark the presence of layer boundaries and the reduction by laser ablation of the thickness of the varnish coating. The obtained MPEF and THG data are complemented by morphological observation by optical microscopy and measurements of laser induced fluorescence and micro-Raman spectra of the samples before and after laser ablation at the selected laser irradiation conditions. The results acquired through these nondestructive NLM imaging techniques serve to understand the phenomena that are induced upon laser ablation and to determine the best operating conditions that ensure controlled removal of the varnish with minimal morphological and chemical modifications to the under-layers. This research is of direct application to the UV pulsed laser cleaning of paintings and demonstrates the potential of NLM as a novel assessment tool for non-destructive, on line monitoring of the laser cleaning process.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.8cz8w9gn6,open,The relationship between a combinatorial processing rule and a continuous mate preference function in an insect,"<p>Mate choice involves processing signals that can reach high levels of complexity and feature multiple components, even in small animals with tiny brains. This raises the question of whether and how such organisms deal with this complexity. One solution involves combinatorial processing, whereby different signal elements are processed as single units. Combinatorial processing has been described in several mammals and birds, and recently in a vibrationally signalling insect, Enchenopa treehoppers. Here, we ask about the relationship between combinatorial rules and mate preferences for continuously varying signal features. Enchenopa male advertisement signals are composed of two elements: a 'whine' followed by a set of pulses. The dominant frequency of the whine and element combination both matter to females. We presented synthetic signals varying in element order (natural [whine-pulses], reverse [pulses-whine]) and in frequency to Enchenopa females and recorded their responses. The reverse combination resulted in a decrease in attractiveness of the signals, and also slightly changed the shape of the preference for frequency. We found that females could be classified into three 'types': females with both a strong preference and a strong combinatorial rule, females with both a weak preference and weak rule and females with a strong preference but a weak rule. Our results suggest that in Enchenopa signal processing, the mate preference for a continuous signal feature 'takes precedence' over, but also interacts with, the combinatorial rule. The relationship between the preference and the rule could evolve to take different forms according to selection on mate choice decisions. We suggest that exploring the relationship between such preferences and rules in species with more complex signals will bring insight into the evolution of the multi-component communication systems.</p>"

10.5281/zenodo.3948424,open,On the donor substrate dependence of group transfer reactions by hydrolytic enzymes: insight from kinetic analysis of sucrose phosphorylase-catalyzed transglycosylation,"<p>We provide here the underlying data of the publication &quot;On the donor substrate dependence of group transfer reactions by hydrolytic enzymes: insight from kinetic analysis of sucrose phosphorylase-catalyzed transglycosylation&quot;. Please find the abstract below.</p>

<p>Chemical group-transfer reactions by hydrolytic enzymes have considerable importance in biocatalytic synthesis and are exploited broadly in commercial-scale chemical production. Mechanistically, these reactions have in common the involvement of a covalent enzyme intermediate which is formed upon enzyme reaction with the donor substrate and is subsequently intercepted by a suitable acceptor. Here, we studied the glycosylation of glycerol from sucrose by sucrose phosphorylase (SucP) to clarify a peculiar, yet generally important characteristic of this reaction: partitioning between glycosylation of glycerol and hydrolysis depends on the type and the concentration of the donor substrate used (here: sucrose, &alpha;-D-glucose 1-phosphate (G1P)). We develop a kinetic framework to analyze the effect and provide evidence that, when G1P is used as donor substrate, hydrolysis occurs not only from the &beta;-glucosyl-enzyme intermediate (E-Glc), but additionally from a noncovalent complex of E-Glc and substrate which unlike E-Glc is unreactive to glycerol. Depending on the relative rates of hydrolysis of free and substrate-bound E-Glc, inhibition (Leuconostoc mesenteroides SucP) or apparent activation (Bifidobacterium adolescentis SucP) is observed at high donor substrate concentration. At a G1P concentration that excludes the substrate-bound E-Glc, the transfer/hydrolysis ratio changes to a value consistent with reaction exclusively through E-Glc, independent of the donor substrate used. Collectively, these results give explanation for a kinetic behavior of SucP not previously accounted for, provide essential basis for design and optimization of the synthetic reaction, and establish a theoretical framework for the analysis of kinetically analogous group transfer reactions by hydrolytic enzymes.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.m2v4m,open,Data from: Using multiple imputation to estimate missing data in meta-regression,"1. There is a growing need for scientific synthesis in ecology and evolution. In many cases, meta-analytic techniques can be used to complement such synthesis. However, missing data is a serious problem for any synthetic efforts and can compromise the integrity of meta-analyses in these and other disciplines. Currently, the prevalence of missing data in meta-analytic datasets in ecology and the efficacy of different remedies for this problem have not been adequately quantified. 2. We generated meta-analytic datasets based on literature reviews of experimental and observational data and found that missing data were prevalent in meta-analytic ecological datasets. We then tested the performance of complete case removal (a widely used method when data are missing) and multiple imputation (an alternative method for data recovery) and assessed model bias, precision, and multi-model rankings under a variety of simulated conditions using published meta-regression datasets. 3. We found that complete case removal led to biased and imprecise coefficient estimates and yielded poorly specified models. In contrast, multiple imputation provided unbiased parameter estimates with only a small loss in precision. The performance of multiple imputation, however, was dependent on the type of data missing. It performed best when missing values were weighting variables, but performance was mixed when missing values were predictor variables. Multiple imputation performed poorly when imputing raw data which was then used to calculate effect size and the weighting variable. 4. We conclude that complete case removal should not be used in meta-regression, and that multiple imputation has the potential to be an indispensable tool for meta-regression in ecology and evolution. However, we recommend that users assess the performance of multiple imputation by simulating missing data on a subset of their data before implementing it to recover actual missing data."

Dyslipidemia has been suggested to alter Treg cell migration by affecting the expression of specific membrane proteins, thereby decreasing Treg cell migration towards atherosclerotic lesions. Besides membrane proteins, cellular metabolism has been shown to be a crucial factor in Treg cell migration. We aimed to determine whether dyslipidemia contributes to altered migration of Treg cells, in part, by affecting cellular metabolism.</p>

<p><b>Methods and results:</b> Dyslipidemia was induced by feeding <i>Ldlr</i><sup>-/- </sup>mice a Western-type diet for 16-20 weeks and intrinsic changes in Treg cells affecting their migration and metabolism were examined. Dyslipidemia was associated with altered mTORC2 signaling in Treg cells, decreased expression of membrane proteins involved in migration, including CD62L, CCR7 and S1Pr1, and decreased Treg cell migration towards lymph nodes. Furthermore, we discovered that diet-induced dyslipidemia inhibited mTORC1 signaling, induced PPARδ activation and increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation in Treg cells. Moreover, mass-spectrometry analysis of serum from <i>Ldlr</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice with normolipidemia or dyslipidemia showed increases in multiple PPARδ ligands during dyslipidemia. Treatment with a synthetic PPARδ agonist increased the migratory capacity of Treg cells <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo</i> in an FA oxidation dependent manner. Furthermore, diet-induced dyslipidemia actually enhanced Treg cell migration into the inflamed peritoneum and into atherosclerotic lesions <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions:</b> Altogether, our findings implicate that dyslipidemia does not contribute to atherosclerosis by impairing Treg cell migration as dyslipidemia associated with an effector-like migratory phenotype in Treg cells.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.gn818,open,Data from: Plant functional composition affects soil processes in novel successional grasslands,"1. Secondary succession may lead to novel, exotic-dominated community states differing in structure and function from the original native counterparts. We hypothesized that grassland soil processes associated with C and N cycling decelerate with community turnover from short-lived forbs and grasses to long-lived native grasses, whereas invasion by exotic perennial grasses maintains fast cycling rates. 2.  We measured litter C and N turnover during decomposition, soil respiration, and soil N dynamics in synthetic plant communities resembling four successional stages, established on abandoned farmland in the Inland Pampa, Argentina. We also compared litter chemistry and decay rates of dominant species from each community stage in a common garden, and assessed mass loss for a standard litter type incubated in all communities. 3.  Litter decomposition and soil respiration decreased, while litter N retention increased from early, through mid to late community stages dominated by forbs, short-lived grasses and native perennial grasses, respectively. Soil process rates in exotic perennial grass communities were faster than in native grass communities, but similar to annual grass communities. Further, the standard litter decomposed more slowly in the native perennial than in the exotic perennial grass community. In the common garden, short-lived forbs and grasses decomposed faster than native or exotic perennial grasses, with species' decay rates being negatively related to initial litter C:N ratio. 4. Our results show that changes in soil processes across old-field communities arise chiefly through differences in the quality of litter produced by dominant functional groups. A dominance shift from native to exotic perennial grasses prevented the deceleration of C and N cycling expected with plant successional turnover. Thus invasion by fast-growing exotic grasses may fundamentally alter ecosystem functioning in novel grasslands."
10.5061/dryad.c59zw3r6w,open,What is the current extent of our systematic knowledge? A case study in synthesizing phylogenetic data for building large trees to advance phylogenetic research in Orobanchaceae,"To date, no comprehensive phylogenetic analyses have been conducted in Orobanchaceae that include both a wide generic sampling and a large sampling of species. Here, we utilize a recently developed set of tools for synthesizing publicly available data, and apply these to assess where the gaps in our phylogenetic knowledge exist in the angiosperm clade Orobanchaceae. We then use the resulting timetree to investigate diversification dynamics in this clade of mostly parasitic plants. We used the PyPHLAWD pipeline and RAxML to assemble a supermatrix of &gt;900 species and construct a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis of Orobanchaceae. Divergence times were estimated with penalized likelihood from a 'congruified' set of secondary calibrations, and diversification dynamics were investigated in both trait-independent and trait-dependent (parasitic habit) contexts with BAMM and HiSSE. We sampled 39.8% of described species from 80 of 108 genera, representing all eight
primary clades of Orobanchaceae. Relationships and divergence time estimates were similar to previous, clade-specific studies; however, eight genera were recovered as non-monophyletic, and will require focused systematic attention. Ours is first Orobanchaceae wide study to use model based approach to assess diversification dynamics in the parasitic lineage. Our results reveal elevated diversification rates associated with hemiparasitic habit, and holoparasitic habit was revealed to be an absorbing state, meaning that lineages within Orobanchaceae tend towards a reduction in photosynthetic towards hemiparasitism and finally holoparasitism.
Using a synthetic phylogenetic hypothesis in conjunction with a unified taxonomic framework, we are able to understand where our taxonomic and phylogenetic knowledge is incomplete or conflicting, and we predict that this approach will aid in identifying where to focus future systematic efforts in any clade of interest. For Orobanchaceae, our phylogeny reflects the most recent taxonomy, and provides a new, comprehensive temporal framework for the clade that can serve as a stepping-stone for future macroevolutionary studies."
10.5061/dryad.z34tmpgb2,open,Data from: Stream microbial communities and ecosystem functioning show complex responses to multiple stressors in wastewater,"<div>
<p>Multiple anthropogenic drivers are changing ecosystems globally, with a disproportionate and intensifying impact on freshwater habitats. A major impact of urbanisation are inputs from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Initially designed to greatly reduce nutrient loads, WWTPs increasingly release a multitude of micropollutants (i.e., synthetic chemicals) and organisms (including antibiotic resistant bacteria) to receiving environments. This pollution may have pervasive impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Viewed through multiple lenses of macroecological and ecotoxicological theory, we combined field, flume, and laboratory experiments to determine the effects of wastewater on microbial communities and organic-matter processing using a standardized decomposition assay. Firstly, we conducted a mensurative experiment using 60 sampling locations above and below WWTP discharges in 20 Swiss streams. This showed that microbial respiration and decomposition rates were positively influenced by inputs of treated effluent via warming and nutrient enrichment, but with a notable exception: wastewater decreased the activation energy of decomposition, indicating a ""slowing"" of this fundamental ecosystem process in response to temperature. Secondly, next-generation sequencing of microbial communities indicated that community structure below WWTPs was altered, with significant compositional turnover, reduced fungal richness, and evidence of negative micropollutant influences. Thirdly, a series of flume experiments confirmed that although diluted wastewater generally has a positive influence on microbial-mediated processes, the negative effects of micropollutants are 'masked' by the addition of nutrients. Finally, cotton-strip transplant experiments suggested that wastewater-borne microbes enhance rates of decomposition. Taken together, our results affirm the multiple-stressor paradigm by showing that different aspects of wastewater (i.e., temperature, nutrients, microbes, and micropollutants) jointly influence ecosystem functioning in complex ways. Increased respiration rates below WWTPs potentially generate ecosystem 'disservices' via greater carbon evasion from streams and rivers. However, toxic effects of micropollutants may fundamentally alter ecological scaling relationships, indicating the need for a rapprochement between ecotoxicological and macroecological perspectives.</p>

10.5061/dryad.v43rd,open,Data from: A relaxed directional random walk model for phylogenetic trait evolution,"Understanding the processes that give rise to quantitative measurements associated with molecular sequence data remains an important issue in statistical phylogenetics. Examples of such measurements include geographic coordinates in the context of phylogeography and phenotypic traits in the context of comparative studies. A popular approach is to model the evolution of continuously varying traits as a Brownian diffusion process acting on a phylogenetic tree. However, standard Brownian diffusion is quite restrictive and may not accurately characterize certain trait evolutionary processes. Here, we relax one of the major restrictions of standard Brownian diffusion by incorporating a nontrivial estimable mean into the process. We introduce a relaxed directional random walk (RDRW) model for the evolution of multivariate continuously varying traits along a phylogenetic tree. Notably, the RDRW model accommodates branch-specific variation of directional trends while preserving model identifiability. Furthermore, our development of a computationally efficient dynamic programming approach to compute the data likelihood enables scaling of our method to large data sets frequently encountered in phylogenetic comparative studies and viral evolution. We implement the RDRW model in a Bayesian inference framework to simultaneously reconstruct the evolutionary histories of molecular sequence data and associated multivariate continuous trait data, and provide tools to visualize evolutionary reconstructions. We demonstrate the performance of our model on synthetic data, and we illustrate its utility in two viral examples. First, we examine the spatiotemporal spread of HIV-1 in central Africa and show that the RDRW model uncovers a clearer, more detailed picture of the dynamics of viral dispersal than standard Brownian diffusion. Second, we study antigenic evolution in the context of HIV-1 resistance to three broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our analysis reveals evidence of a continuous drift at the HIV-1 population level towards enhanced resistance to neutralization by the VRC01 monoclonal antibody over the course of the epidemic."
10.5061/dryad.bh52d,open,Data from: Hysteretic dynamics of active particles in a periodic orienting field,"Active motion of living organisms and artificial self-propelling particles has been an area of intense research at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics. Significant progress in understanding these phenomena has been related to the observation that dynamic self-organization in active systems has much in common with ordering in equilibrium condensed matter such as spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnets. The velocities of active particles may behave similar to magnetic dipoles and develop global alignment, although interactions between the individuals might be completely different. In this work, we show that the dynamics of active particles in external fields can also be described in a way that resembles equilibrium condensed matter. It follows simple general laws, which are independent of the microscopic details of the system. The dynamics is revealed through hysteresis of the mean velocity of active particles subjected to a periodic orienting field. The hysteresis is measured in computer simulations and experiments on unicellular organisms. We find that the ability of the particles to follow the field scales with the ratio of the field variation period to the particles' orientational relaxation time, which, in turn, is related to the particle self-propulsion power and the energy dissipation rate. The collective behaviour of the particles due to aligning interactions manifests itself at low frequencies via increased persistence of the swarm motion when compared with motion of an individual. By contrast, at high field frequencies, the active group fails to develop the alignment and tends to behave like a set of independent individuals even in the presence of interactions. We also report on asymptotic laws for the hysteretic dynamics of active particles, which resemble those in magnetic systems. The generality of the assumptions in the underlying model suggests that the observed laws might apply to a variety of dynamic phenomena from the motion of synthetic active particles to crowd or opinion dynamics."
10.5281/zenodo.5588467,open,A surface water data set of China derived from optical and radar remote sensing,"<p>Satellite remote sensing provides an efficient way to map terrestrial surface water at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, how to combine optical and SAR remote sensing to derive seamless surface water map still poses challenges and requires further investigation. In this study, a novel Seamless Surface Water Mapping Framework (SSWMF) is proposed by synergizing multi-source optical (MODIS, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR, i.e., Sentinel-1) imageries. In this framework, optical remote sensing datasets with different spatial and temporal resolutions are first fused to maximize the possibility of excluding cloud effect on surface water detection, and then combined with historical contemporaneous surface water extent to facilitate SAR imagery for surface water extraction. Finally, the fine-resolution seamless water map generated using the optical- and SAR-based fine resolution surface water maps can provide large-scale surface water information. The SSWMF was first validated over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), and results indicate the framework can provide spatially and temporally continuous surface water map for MLYR and well characterize the seasonality feature of surface water coverage in MLYR. The SSWMF is then applied to China, with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for the extracted surface water map of 92.39 % and 0.83, respectively. The extracted surface water area is quite close to the statistics of surface water area in China from the first national geoinformation survey of 2018. Multi-source validation proved that the SSWMF-derived surface water maps can well characterize the water dynamic in China during 2018-2020. Overall, a surface water data set of China was derived from optical and radar remote sensing and the results suggest that the proposed water mapping framework is promising and can be used to extend to global-scale applications such as terrestrial water resource management and drought/flood monitoring.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.5082975,open,GWAS to single cell: Intersecting single-cell transcriptomics and genome wide association studies identifies crucial cell-populations and candidate genes for atherosclerosis.,"<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered hundreds of common genetic variants for atherosclerotic disease and cardiovascular risk factors. The translation of susceptibility loci into biological mechanisms and targets for drug discovery remains challenging. Intersecting genetic and gene expression data has led to identification of candidate genes. However, the assayed tissues are often non-diseased and heterogeneous in cell composition confounding the candidate prioritization. We collected single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) from atherosclerotic plaques and aimed to identify cell-type-specific expression of disease-associated genes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Methods and Results</strong></p>

<p>To identify disease-associated candidate genes, we applied gene-based analyses using GWAS summary statistics from 46 atherosclerotic, cardiometabolic, and other traits. Next we intersected these candidates with single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) to identify those genes that are specifically expressed in individual cell (sub)populations of atherosclerotic plaques. We derive an enrichment score and show that loci that associated with coronary artery disease demonstrated a prominent substrate in plaque smooth muscle cells (<em>SKI</em>, <em>KANK2</em>, <em>SORT1</em>), endothelial cells (<em>SLC44A1</em>, <em>ATP2B1</em>), and macrophages (<em>APOE</em>, <em>HNRNPUL1</em>). Further sub clustering of SMC-subtypes revealed genes in risk loci for coronary calcification specifically enriched in a synthetic cluster of SMCs. To verify the robustness of our approach, we used liver-derived scRNAseq-data and showed enrichment of circulating lipids-associated loci in hepatocytes.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>We confirm known gene-cell pairs relevant for atherosclerotic disease, and discovered novel pairs pointing to new biological mechanisms amenable for therapy. We present an intuitive single-cell transcriptomics driven workflow rooted in human large-scale genetic studies to identify putative candidate genes and affected cells associated with cardiovascular traits.</p>

10.5061/dryad.sv0q9,open,"Data from: Method to assess the temporal persistence of potential biometric features: application to oculomotor, gait, face and brain structure databases","We introduce the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to the biometric community as an index of the temporal persistence, or stability, of a single biometric feature. It requires, as input, a feature on an interval or ratio scale, and which is reasonably normally distributed, and it can only be calculated if each subject is tested on 2 or more occasions. For a biometric system, with multiple features available for selection, the ICC can be used to measure the relative stability of each feature. We show, for 14 distinct data sets (1 synthetic, 8 eye-movement-related, 2 gait-related, and 2 face-recognition-related, and one brain-structure-related), that selecting the most stable features, based on the ICC, resulted in the best biometric performance generally. Analyses based on using only the most stable features produced superior Rank-1-Identification Rate (Rank-1-IR) performance in 12 of 14 databases (p = 0.0065, one-tailed), when compared to other sets of features, including the set of all features. For Equal Error Rate (EER), using a subset of only high-ICC features also produced superior performance in 12 of 14 databases (p = 0. 0065, one-tailed). In general, then, for our databases, prescreening potential biometric features, and choosing only highly reliable features yields better performance than choosing lower ICC features or than choosing all features combined. We also determined that, as the ICC of a group of features increases, the median of the genuine similarity score distribution increases and the spread of this distribution decreases. There was no statistically significant similar relationships for the impostor distributions. We believe that the ICC will find many uses in biometric research. In case of the eye movement-driven biometrics, the use of reliable features, as measured by ICC, allowed to us achieve the authentication performance with EER = 2.01%, which was not possible before."
10.5061/dryad.4m0v8474,open,Data from: Not all sequence tags are created equal: designing and validating sequence identification tags robust to indels,"Ligating adapters with unique synthetic oligonucleotide sequences (sequence tags) onto individual DNA samples before massively parallel sequencing is a popular and efficient way to obtain sequence data from many individual samples.  Tag sequences should be numerous and sufficiently different to ensure sequencing, replication, and oligonucleotide synthesis errors do not cause tags to be unrecoverable or confused.  However, many design approaches only protect against substitution errors during sequencing and extant tag sets contain too few tag sequences. We developed an open-source software package to validate sequence tags for conformance to two distance metrics and design sequence tags robust to indel and substitution errors. We use this software package to evaluate several commercial and non-commercial sequence tag sets, design several large sets (maxcount=7,198) of edit metric sequence tags having different lengths and degrees of error correction, and integrate a subset of these edit metric tags to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and sequencing adapters. We validate a subset of these edit metric tagged PCR primers and sequencing adapters by sequencing on several platforms and subsequent comparison to commercially available alternatives. We find that several commonly used sets of sequence tags or design methodologies used to produce sequence tags do not meet the minimum expectations of their underlying distance metric, and we find that PCR primers and sequencing adapters incorporating edit metric sequence tags designed by our software package perform as well as their commercial counterparts. We suggest that researchers evaluate sequence tags prior to use or evaluate tags that they have been using. The sequence tag sets we design improve on extant sets because they are large, valid across the set, and robust to the suite of substitution, insertion, and deletion errors affecting massively parallel sequencing workflows on all currently used platforms."

Ghezzehei,"<p>Simulation of soil moisture dynamics is important for various fields, such as agriculture, hydrological modeling, and natural disasters. Such simulations are conducted by solving a partial differential equation (PDE) called the Richardson-Richards equation (RRE). Because the RRE is a highly non-linear PDE, we need to solve it numerically. Various numerical methods have been used to solve the RRE, such as the finite difference, finite element, and finite element volume method. In order for those numerical methods to produce correct solutions, they require precise information on initial and boundary conditions, as well as hydraulic properties of soils.

Genome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering genome regions linked with traits underlying life history variation in a range of species. However, lack of functional studies of the discovered genotype-phenotype associations severely restrains our understanding how alternative life history traits evolved and are mediated at the molecular level. Here, we report a <i>cis</i>-regulatory mechanism whereby expression of alternative isoforms of the transcription co-factor <i>vestigial-like 3</i> (<i>vgll3</i>) associate with variation in a key life history trait, age at maturity, in Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>).

10.5061/dryad.brv15dv7n,open,Seasonal upwelling reduces herbivore control of tropical rocky intertidal algal communities,"<p>Communities are shaped by a variety of ecological and environmental processes, each acting at different spatial scales. Seminal research on rocky shores highlighted the effects of consumers as local determinants of primary productivity and community assembly. However, it is now clear that the species interactions shaping communities at local scales are themselves regulated by large-scale oceanographic processes that generate regional variation in resource availability. Upwelling events deliver nutrient-rich water to coastal ecosystems, influencing primary productivity and algal-herbivore interactions. Despite the potential for upwelling to alter top-down control by herbivores, we know relatively little about the coupling between oceanographic processes and herbivory on tropical rocky shores, where herbivore effects on producers are considered to be strong. By replicating seasonal molluscan herbivore exclusion experiments across three regions exposed to varying intensity of seasonal upwelling, separated by hundreds of kilometers along Panama's Pacific coast, we examine large-scale environmental determinants of consumer effects and community structure on tropical rocky shores. At sites experiencing seasonal upwelling, grazers strongly limited macroalgal cover when upwelling was absent, leading to dominance by crustose algae. As nutrients increased and surface water cooled during upwelling events, increases in primary productivity temporarily weakened herbivory, allowing foliose, turf and filamentous algae to replace crusts. Meanwhile, grazer effects were persistently strong at sites without seasonal upwelling. Our results confirm that herbivores are key determinants of tropical algal cover, however, our focus on regional oceanographic conditions revealed that bottom-up processes regulate top-down control on tropical shorelines. This study expands on the extensive body of work highlighting the influence of upwelling on local ecological processes by demonstrating that nutrient subsidies delivered by upwelling events can weaken herbivory in tropical rocky shores.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.tt367,open,Data from: Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions,"To systematically explore complex genetic interactions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic interactions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction network and tested for a genetic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship."

10.5061/dryad.25pp406,open,Data from: Engineered action at a distance: blood-meal-inducible paralysis in Aedes aegypti,"Background: Population suppression through mass-release of Aedes aegypti males carrying dominant-lethal transgenes has been demonstrated in the field. Where population dynamics show negative density-dependence, suppression can be enhanced if lethality occurs after the density-dependent (i.e. larval) stage. Existing molecular tools have limited current examples of such Genetic Pest Management (GPM) systems to achieving this through engineering 'cell-autonomous effectors' i.e. where the expressed deleterious protein is restricted to the cells in which it is expressed – usually under the control of the regulatory elements (e.g. promoter regions) used to build the system. This limits the flexibility of these technologies as regulatory regions with useful spatial, temporal or sex-specific expression patterns may only be employed if the cells they direct expression in are simultaneously sensitive to existing effectors, and also precludes the targeting of extracellular regions such as cell-surface receptors. Expanding the toolset to 'non-cell autonomous' effectors would significantly reduce these limitations.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We sought to engineer female-specific, late-acting lethality through employing the Ae. aegypti VitellogeninA1 promoter to drive blood-meal-inducible, fat-body specific expression of tTAV. Initial attempts using pro-apoptotic effectors gave no evident phenotype, potentially due to the lower sensitivity of terminally-differentiated fat-body cells to programmed-death signals. Subsequently, we dissociated the temporal and spatial expression of this system by engineering a novel synthetic effector (Scorpion neurotoxin – TetO-gp67.AaHIT) designed to be secreted out of the tissue in which it was expressed (fat-body) and then affect cells elsewhere (neuro-muscular junctions). This resulted in a striking, temporary-paralysis phenotype after blood-feeding. 

Conclusions/Significance: These results are significant in demonstrating for the first time an engineered 'action at a distance' phenotype in a non-model pest insect. The potential to dissociate temporal and spatial expression patterns of useful endogenous regulatory elements will extend to a variety of other pest insects and effectors."
10.5281/zenodo.3531786,open,Nonlinear imaging microscopy for assessing structural and photochemical modifications upon laser removal of dammar varnish on photosensitive substrates,"<p>Varnish layers are commonly used to protect painted surfaces from atmospheric pollution, oxidation<br>
and improve the aesthetic appearance of the artwork by providing an even surface finish, brilliance and<br>
depth to the colours. However, the outer varnish layers suffer from progressive deterioration due to<br>
aging and the continuous exposure to aggressive environmental conditions, imposing the need of their<br>
removal for rectifying the optical and aesthetic properties of the painting and extend its lifetime. The<br>
removal of the surface varnish layer, without affecting the painting substrate, comprises a delicate<br>
intervention in cultural heritage (CH) conservation.<br>
The main objective of this study is to determine by nonlinear imaging microscopy (NLM) the extent of<br>
the photochemical damage that could be induced on underlying painting layers by laser removal of<br>
varnish protective coatings. This will lead to the identification of the optimal laser cleaning conditions<br>
that produce the minimum collateral damage to the painting layers.<br>
The current study is undertaken using model samples constituted by bilayers, where the top varnish<br>
layer (dammar) coats a bottom layer constituted by a doped synthetic polymer (polymetilmetacrilate,<br>
PMMA doped with POPUP) film, the latter mimicking a paint layer. The target is to determine the<br>
affected region as a function of depth of the doped polymer layer induced by laser ablation of the<br>
varnish. To this aim we use the non destructive NLM imaging modalities of third harmonic generation<br>
(THG) and multiphoton excitation fluorescence (MPEF) as novel diagnostic tools and a number of<br>
laser conditions for varnish removal, namely different ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths and pulse durations.<br>
Characterization of the samples by NLM is complemented by spectroscopic micro-Raman and laser<br>
induced fluorescence (one-photon excitation) measurements. These provide a full characterization of<br>
the lateral and in-depth chemical and morphological changes following laser removal of the varnish<br>
protective layer.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.kh6j6,open,Data from: Does primary productivity modulate the indirect effects of large herbivores? A global meta-analysis,"1. Indirect effects of large mammalian herbivores (LMH), while much less studied than those of apex predators, are increasingly recognized to exert powerful influences on communities and ecosystems. The strength of these effects is spatiotemporally variable, and several sets of authors have suggested that they are governed in part by primary productivity. However, prior theoretical and field studies have generated conflicting results and predictions, underscoring the need for a synthetic global analysis.
2. We conducted a meta-analysis of the direction and magnitude of large mammalian herbivore-initiated indirect interactions using 67 published studies comprising 456 individual responses. We georeferenced 41 of these studies (comprising 253 responses from 33 locations on 5 continents) to a satellite-derived map of primary productivity. Because predator assemblages might also influence the impact of large herbivores, we conducted a similar analysis using a global map of large-carnivore species richness.
3. In general, LMH reduced the abundance of other consumer species and also tended to reduce consumer richness, although the latter effect was only marginally significant.
4. There was a pronounced reduction in the strength of negative (i.e., suppressive, due e.g. to competition) indirect effects of LMH on consumer abundance in more productive ecosystems. In contrast, positive (facilitative) indirect effects were not significantly correlated with productivity, likely because these comprised a more heterogeneous array of mechanisms. We found no effect of carnivore species richness on herbivore-initiated indirect effect strength.
5. Our findings help to resolve the fundamental problem of ecological contingency as it pertains to the strength of an under-studied class of multi-trophic interactions. Moreover, these results will aid in predicting the indirect effects of anthropogenic wildlife declines and irruptions, and how these effects might be mediated by climatically driven shifts in resource availability. To the extent that intact ungulate guilds help to suppress populations of small animals that act as agricultural pests and disease reservoirs, the negative impacts of large-mammal declines on human well-being may be relatively stronger in low-productivity areas."
10.5061/dryad.71r6q,open,Data from: Ecosystem response to interventions: lessons from restored and created wetland ecosystems,"1. Current efforts to restore and create ecosystems require greater understanding of ecosystems' responses to commonly used physical and biological intervention approaches to overcome ecological and technological limitations. 2. We estimated effect sizes from measurements of biotic assemblage structure and biogeochemical functions at 628 restored and created wetlands globally, in comparison with 499 reference wetlands. We studied the recovery trajectories of wetlands where different restoration or creation approaches were used under different environmental settings. 3. Although the variance explained by a linear mixed-effects models was low (6–7%), the study of recovery trajectories showed that the restoration or creation approach had no significant effects in most environmental settings. 4. In particular, wetlands where surface modification and flow re-establishment were used followed similar recovery trajectories regardless of whether they were revegetated or not. We even found potential detrimental effects of biological manipulations on the recovery of the plant assemblage, particularly in cold climates and in wetlands restored or created in agricultural areas. 5. Since physical interventions are required to recover or create the hydrological conditions of degraded or new wetlands, and given the high cost (22–73%) of biological interventions (i.e. revegetation), the need for biological interventions is, in most cases, unclear. 6. Our results highlight the urgent need to increase our understanding of the long-term effects of restoration and creation actions in our aim to engage in large-scale ecosystem management strategies for wetlands. 7. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that, currently, the recovery and development processes of restored and created wetlands can be driven by spontaneous processes rather than by the response of wetlands to human interventions other than those targeted to restore hydrological conditions that existed prior to disturbance. However, given the synthetic nature of the data set, the mixed nature of available data, and the limited number of measures we found to estimate recovery, caution must be exercised when adapting the results presented here to the planning and execution of specific ecosystem restoration projects."

10.5061/dryad.x0k6djhh9,open,An endangered bird calls less when invasive birds are calling,"<p>Novel noises can affect various animal behaviours, and changes to vocal behaviour are some of the most documented. The calls of invasive species are an important source of novel noise, yet their effects on native species are poorly understood. We examined the effects of invasive bird calls on the vocal activity of an endangered Australian finch to investigate whether: (i) native finch calling behaviour was affected by novel invasive bird calls, and (ii) the calls of the finches overlapped in frequency with those of invasive birds. We exposed a wild population of Black-throated Finch southern subspecies (<i>Poephila cincta cincta</i>) to the vocalisations of two invasive birds, Nutmeg Mannikins (<i>Lonchura punctulata</i>) and Common Mynas (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>), a synthetic 'pink' noise, and a silent control. To determine whether the amount of Black-throated Finch calling differed in response to treatments, we recorded and quantified Black-throated Finch vocalisations, and assessed the amount of calling using a generalised linear mixed model followed by pairwise comparisons. We also measured, for both Black-throated Finches and the stimulus noises: dominant, minimum and maximum frequency, and assessed the degree of frequency overlap between Black-throated Finch calls and stimulus noises. Compared to silent controls, Black-throated Finches called less when exposed to Common Myna calls and pink noise, but not to Nutmeg Mannikin calls. We also found that pink noise overlapped most in frequency with Black-throated Finch calls. Common Myna calls also somewhat overlapped the frequency range of Black-throated Finch calls, whereas Nutmeg Mannikin calls overlapped the least. It is possible that masking interference is the mechanism behind the reduction in calling in response to Common Myna calls and pink noise, but more work is needed to resolve this. Regardless, these results indicate that the calls of invasive species can affect the behaviour of native species, and future research should aim to understand the scope and severity of this issue.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.0vt4b8h0j,open,Data from: Isotopic niches of tropical birds reduced by anthropogenic impacts: A 100-year perspective,"<p>The intensification of land use changes in tropical forests during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, mainly caused by deforestation for agricultural uses, had an overwhelming influence on bird assemblages. However, how these historical anthropogenic changes have impacted the habitat use and diet of tropical birds is poorly known. Stable isotope analysis (<i>δ</i><sup>13</sup>C and <i>δ</i><sup>15</sup>N) can be useful in this regard since it provides information not only on the habitat and food resource use but also insights on the dietary niche of species. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether centenary anthropogenic impacts, mainly caused by changes in landscape composition, have affected the resource and habitat use and isotopic niche width of Neotropical birds in a region that comprises two biodiversity hotspots — the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado in southeastern Brazil. We found that the niche width of all bird guilds (frugivore, granivore, insectivore, nectarivore, and omnivore) was largely reduced (28–70%) from the twentieth century until recently. This niche width reduction was likely associated with historical anthropogenic impacts (e.g., fragmentation, forest loss and change in agricultural practices), which are responsible for the decrease in the availability of habitat and food resources. Moreover, the mean values of <i>δ</i><sup>15</sup>N decreased over the years in all bird guilds, which might be attributed to the expansion of agricultural areas and the increase in the use of synthetic nitrogen-based fertilizers. All the analyzed species, even though some of them are diet and habitat generalists, were strongly influenced by centenary anthropogenic actions. Our results show the consequences of human-induced changes in land use on the diet and habitat use of tropical birds that persist in fragmented landscapes, which might compromise their long-term survival, and provide useful information to the conservation strategies of bird assemblages in modern landscapes.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.1756f,open,Data from: Ecological intensification and arbuscular mycorrhizas: a meta-analysis of tillage and cover crop effects,"1. Reliance on ecosystem services instead of synthetic, non-renewable inputs is increasingly seen as key to achieving food security in an environmentally sustainable way. This process, known as ecological intensification, will depend in large part on enhancing below-ground biological interactions that facilitate resource use efficiency. Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations formed between the roots of most terrestrial plant species and a specialized group of soil fungi, provide valuable ecosystem services, but the full magnitude of these services may not be fully realized under conventional intensively-managed annual agricultural systems.

2. Here we use meta-analysis to assess how reducing soil disturbance and periods without roots in agricultural systems affects the formation of AM and the diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We compiled data from 54 field studies across five continents that measured effects of tillage and/or cover cropping on AMF colonization and/or communities and assessed effects of management and environmental factors on these responses.

3. Less intensive tillage and winter cover cropping similarly increased AMF colonization of summer annual cash crop roots by ~30%. The key variables influencing the change in AMF colonization were the type of cover crop or the type of alternative tillage, suggesting that farmers can optimize combinations of tillage and cover crops that most enhance AM formation, particularly with no-till systems and legume cover crops.

4. Richness of AMF taxa increased by 11% in low-intensity vs. conventional tillage regimes. Several studies showed changes in diversity and community composition of AMF with cover cropping, but these responses were not consistent.

5. Synthesis and applications. This meta-analysis indicates that less intensive tillage and cover cropping are both viable strategies for enhancing root colonization from indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) across a wide range of soil types and cash crop species, and possibly also shifting AMF community structure, which could in turn increase biologically-based resource use in agricultural systems."

10.5061/dryad.6jg71,open,Data from: Two influential primate classifications logically aligned,"Classifications and phylogenies of perceived natural entities change in the light of new evidence. Taxonomic changes, translated into Code-compliant names, frequently lead to name:meaning dissociations across succeeding treatments. Classification standards such as the Mammal Species of the World (MSW) may experience significant levels of taxonomic change from one edition to the next, with potential costs to long-term, large-scale information integration. This circumstance challenges the biodiversity and phylogenetic data communities to express taxonomic congruence and incongruence in ways that both humans and machines can process, that is, to logically represent taxonomic alignments across multiple classifications. We demonstrate that such alignments are feasible for two classifications of primates corresponding to the second and third MSW editions. Our approach has three main components: (i) use of taxonomic concept labels, that is name sec. author (where sec. means according to), to assemble each concept hierarchy separately via parent/child relationships; (ii) articulation of select concepts across the two hierarchies with user-provided Region Connection Calculus (RCC-5) relationships; and (iii) the use of an Answer Set Programming toolkit to infer and visualize logically consistent alignments of these input constraints. Our use case entails the Primates sec. Groves (1993; MSW2–317 taxonomic concepts; 233 at the species level) and Primates sec. Groves (2005; MSW3–483 taxonomic concepts; 376 at the species level). Using 402 RCC-5 input articulations, the reasoning process yields a single, consistent alignment and 153,111 Maximally Informative Relations that constitute a comprehensive meaning resolution map for every concept pair in the Primates sec. MSW2/MSW3. The complete alignment, and various partitions thereof, facilitate quantitative analyses of name:meaning dissociation, revealing that nearly one in three taxonomic names are not reliable across treatments—in the sense of the same name identifying congruent taxonomic meanings. The RCC-5 alignment approach is potentially widely applicable in systematics and can achieve scalable, precise resolution of semantically evolving name usages in synthetic, next-generation biodiversity, and phylogeny data platforms."
10.5061/dryad.026cj63,open,Data from: Comparing radiomic classifiers and classifier ensembles for detection of peripheral zone prostate tumors on T2-weighted MRI: a multi-site study,"Background: For most computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) problems involving prostate cancer detection via medical imaging data, the choice of classifier has been largely ad hoc, or been motivated by classifier comparison studies that have involved larger synthetic datasets. More significantly, it is currently unknown how classifier choices and trends generalize across multiple institutions, due to heterogeneous acquisition and intensity characteristics (especially when considering MR imaging data). In this work, we empirically evaluate and compare a number of different classifiers and classifier ensembles in a multi-site setting, for voxel-wise detection of prostate cancer (PCa) using radiomic texture features derived from high-resolution in vivo T2-weighted (T2w) MRI.

Methods: 12 different supervised classifier schemes: Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), naive Bayes, Decision Trees (DTs), and their ensemble variants (bagging, boosting), were compared in terms of classification accuracy as well as execution time. Our study utilized 86 prostate cancer T2w MRI datasets acquired from across 3 different institutions (1 for discovery, 2 for independent validation), from patients who later underwent radical prostatectomy. Surrogate ground truth for disease extent on MRI was established by expert annotation of pre-operative MRI through spatial correlation with corresponding ex vivo whole-mount histology sections. Classifier accuracy in detecting PCa extent on MRI on a per-voxel basis was evaluated via area under the ROC curve.

Results: The boosted DT classifier yielded the highest cross-validated AUC (= 0.744) for detecting PCa in the discovery cohort. However, in independent validation, the boosted QDA classifier was identified as the most accurate and robust for voxel-wise detection of PCa extent (AUCs of 0.735, 0.683, 0.768 across the 3 sites). The next most accurate and robust classifier was the single QDA classifier, which also enjoyed the advantage of significantly lower computation times compared to any of the other methods.

Conclusions: Our results therefore suggest that simpler classifiers (such as QDA and its ensemble variants) may be more robust, accurate, and efficient for prostate cancer CAD problems, especially in the context of multi-site validation."

10.5281/zenodo.5497723,open,Horizontal and vertical velocities in Ho Chi Minh city by Sentinel-1 radar interferometry,"<p>Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the most crowded city and economic hub of Viet Nam, has been experiencing land subsidence over the past decades. This effort aims to contribute the spatial distribution of subsidence in HCMC in its horizontal and vertical components using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) time series. To this purpose, an advanced Persistent Scatterers and Distributed Scatterers (PSDS) InSAR technique was applied to two European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 datasets consisting of 96 ascending and 202 descending images, acquired from 2014 to 2020 over the HCMC area. The combination of ascending and descending satellite passes is used to decompose the light of sight velocities into horizontal east-west and vertical components. The obtained results revealed that subsidence is most pronounced in the areas along the Sai Gon River, in the northwest-southeast axis, and in the southwest of the city, with a maximum value of 80 mm/yr, which is in accordance with the findings of the literature. The amplitude of east-west horizontal velocities is relatively small and large-scale eastward movement can be observed in the west of the city at a rate of 3-5 mm/yr.</p>

10.5061/dryad.47d7wm3g3,open,Data for effects of MeHg on avian lipid metabolism,"<p>Methylmercury (MeHg) is a global pollutant that can cause metabolic disruptions in animals and thereby potentially compromise the energetic capacity of birds for long-distance migration, but its effects on avian lipid metabolism pathways that support endurance flight and stopover refueling have never been studied. We tested the effects of short-term (14-d), environmentally relevant (0.5 ppm) MeHg exposure on multiple lipid metabolism markers in the pectoralis and livers of yellow-rumped warblers (<em>Setophaga coronata</em>) that were previously found to have poorer flight endurance in a wind tunnel than untreated conspecifics. Compared to controls, MeHg-exposed birds displayed lower muscle aerobic and fatty acid oxidation capacity, but similar muscle glycolytic capacity, fatty acid transporter expression, and PPAR expression. Livers of dosed birds indicated elevated energy costs, lower fatty acid uptake capacity, and lower PPAR-<span>γ </span><span>expression</span>. The lower muscle oxidative enzyme capacity of dosed birds may have caused or contributed to their weaker endurance in the prior study, while the metabolic changes observed in the liver <span>have potential to </span>inhibit lipogenesis and stopover refueling. Our findings provide concerning evidence that fatty acid catabolism, synthesis, and storage pathways in birds can be dysregulated by only brief exposure to MeHg, with potentially significant consequences for migratory performance.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.6t1g1jx0m,open,Adaptive potential of Coffea canephora from Uganda in response to climate change,"<p>Understanding vulnerabilities of plant populations to climate change could help preserve their biodiversity and reveal new elite parents for future breeding programs. To this end, landscape genomics is a useful approach for assessing putative adaptations to future climatic conditions, especially in long-lived species such as trees. We conducted a population genomics study of 207 <i>Coffea canephora</i> trees from seven forests along different climate gradients in Uganda. For this, we sequenced 323 candidate genes involved in key metabolic and defense pathways in coffee. Seventy-one SNPs were found to be significantly associated with bioclimatic variables, and were thereby considered as putatively adaptive loci. These SNPs were linked to key candidate genes, including transcription factors, like <i>DREB</i>-like and <i>MYB</i> family genes controlling plant responses to abiotic stresses, as well as other genes of organoleptic interest, like the <i>DXMT</i> gene involved in caffeine biosynthesis and a putative pest repellent. These climate-associated genetic markers were used to compute genetic offsets, predicting population responses to future climatic conditions based on local climate change forecasts. Using these measures of maladaptation to future conditions, substantial levels of genetic differentiation between present and future diversity were estimated for all populations and scenarios considered. The populations from the forests Zoka and Budongo, in the northernmost zone of Uganda, appeared to have the lowest genetic offsets under all predicted climate change patterns, while populations from Kalangala and Mabira, in the Lake Victoria region, exhibited the highest genetic offsets. The potential of these findings in terms of <i>ex-situ</i> conservation strategies are discussed.</p>"

10.5281/zenodo.4501982,open,Artefact for: Automatic Synthesis of Transiently Correct Network Updates via Petri Games,"<p>This is the artefact for the paper &quot;Automatic Synthesis of Transiently Correct Network Updates via Petri Games&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>

<p>The setup is build for running in an <code>x86_64</code> architecture running Ubuntu 20.04 with python3 installed with the following pip3-package: <code>networkx</code>.</p>

<p>The original experiments were conducted on AMD EPYC 7551 processors with hyperthreading disabled and limited to 25 GB of memory.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>

<p>To create the folder structure needed for running the experiments, please start by running <code>mkdirs.sh</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>networkx</code> library can be installed (in user space) by executing:</p>

<pre><code class=""language-bash"">pip3 install --user networkx</code></pre>

<p>All binaries are included and for repeatability we also include the source-code of the <code>verifypn</code> version used in these experiments. We use the following revision of the <code>verifypn</code> tool: <a href=""https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~verifypn-cpn/verifypn/verifypn-games/revision/269"">https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~verifypn-cpn/verifypn/verifypn-games/revision/269</a></p>

<p>The source code of the revision 269 which is used for these experiments is located in the <code>verifypn</code> subfolder</p>

<p><strong>Running experiments</strong></p>

<p>All models come pre-build, the experiments can be executed sequentially by the following commands:</p>

<pre><code class=""language-bash"">./solve_zoo.sh # experiments on the original, none-nested zoo-topologies
./solve_nested.sh # nested zoo topology experiments
./solve_synthetic.sh # experiments on synthetic networks</code></pre>

<p>Memory, time and execution-environment can be set by setting the variables <code>MEMORY</code>, <code>TIME</code> and <code>EXECUTOR</code> variables in bash prior to execution.</p>

<p>For instance, to limit each single execution to 60 seconds, 500 MB of memory and run using <code>sbatch</code> the following can be used</p>

<pre><code class=""language-bash"">export MEMORY=$((500*1024)) # memory in KB
export TIME=60 # time in seconds
export EXECUTOR=sbatch # to run on a slurm-enabled cluster
./solve_zoo.sh # experiments on the original, none-nested zoo-topologies
./solve_nested.sh # nested zoo topology experiments
./solve_synthethic.sh # experiments on synthetic networks</code></pre>

<p>It will take more than 24 hours to complete the entire experimental setup with a one-hour timeout on a single core. Using a 10 second timeout, a substantial portion of the experiments can be repeated within a few hours.</p>

<p><strong>Data collection</strong></p>

<p>After the execution, data can be collected using the <code>./extract_all.sh</code> script which will generate <code>.csv</code> files for each subfigure of Figure 8 of the paper. The data reported in the <code>.csv</code>-files is in milliseconds for time and kilobytes for memory. Notice that the data collection by <code>./extract_all.sh</code> can take a few minutes to complete.</p>

<p>Notice that the data-folder is pre-populated with the results from the paper - these will be overwritten by a subsequent execution.</p>

<p>These <code>.csv</code> files can be turned into the graphs of the paper using the scripts provided in the <code>plot</code>-subfolder (this requires that <code>gnuplot</code> is installed). From here, plots can be generated by running <code>plot_all.sh</code> for time-plots, or <code>plot_all_mem.sh</code> for memory-plots (not shown in paper). Notice that Figure 9 from the paper corresponds to (a): <code>cactus-disjoint.pdf</code>, (b) <code>cactus-dependent_single.pdf</code>, (c) <code>cactus-dependent_10.pdf</code>, (d) <code>cactus-dependent_5.pdf</code>, (e) <code>shared-single.pdf</code> and (f) <code>cactus-nested.pdf</code>. The remaining plots are from experiments not presented in the paper as they show similar trends to those included in the paper.</p>

<p>Notice that the conrete values given in the paper were found by manual inspection of the generated <code>.csv</code> files. We used a standard spreadsheet software, e.g. using the <code>COUNTIF</code> and <code>AVERAGEIF</code>-functions of libreoffice calc to help with this task.</p>

<p>The raw result output is postfixed with the engine generating the given result-file.</p>

<p>Computed update sequences can be found directly in these raw ouputs for <code>netsynth</code> while the sequences for <code>verifypn</code> are currently written to <code>/dev/null</code> as the verbose output format of <code>verifypn</code> make several of the strategies (implicitly update sequences) take up several gigabytes of space. The strategies of <code>verifypn</code> are still constructed and converted into textual representation and the overhead of doing so is included in the reported runtimes. Notice that there is no uniform output format of the update sequence provided at the moment. However, providing an API for communicating directly with <code>verifypn</code> is fairly straight forward.</p>

<p>Lastly, consistency in the answers between <code>netsynth</code> and <code>verifypn</code> on the &quot;nested&quot; experiment can be checked by the <code>consistent.sh</code> script.</p>

<p><strong>Modifying the experiments</strong></p>

<p>Several parts of the experiments can be modified by changing the values of the generators. Notice that the artefact comes pre-loaded with a pre-generated set of models - so this step is optional.</p>

<p>The <code>Generate_Synthetic.py</code> facilitates the generation of all the synthetic models of the paper. This script will fill the <code>data/synthethic_json</code> folder.</p>

<p>The <code>Generate_Nested.py</code> constructs nested topologies from an existing set of <code>.gml</code>-files. Specifically it iterates through the contents of <code>data/gml/</code> and randomly &quot;subnets&quot; networks into each other. The output is a new set of <code>.gml</code> files located in <code>data/nested_gml/</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Generate_Json.py</code> reads the folders <code>data/gml/</code> and <code>data/nested_gml/</code> and creates (by random) a set of synthesis-problems based on the input topologies. By default the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot;-routes generated are appended up to <code>n</code> times to make harder instances. The value <code>n</code> ranges from 1-5.</p>

<p>Notice that <code>Generate_Json.py</code> can take more than a day to execute, given the rather brute-force nature of the optimization-problem solved for generating the random examples. The results of <code>Generate_Json.py</code> is placed in <code>data/{zoo,nested}_json</code>. Notice also that it is not guaranteed that a &quot;sane&quot; update synthesis problem is generated for all input <code>.gml</code>-files . To be a &quot;sane&quot; update synthesis problem, at least one waypoint must exist. Several attempts are made by the <code>Generate_Json.py</code> script to randomly generate such sane problems, however, this process can fail.</p>

<p>The last step is translation. The <code>Translate.py</code> script converts json-files into both <code>.pnml</code>-files for <code>verifypn</code> and <code>.ltl</code>-files for <code>netsynth</code>. The results are placed in the <code>data/{synthethic,zoo,nested}_{ltl,pn}/</code> folders.</p>"

<p>This dataset regroups 12 yearly files (<em>global-marine-litter-[2010&ndash;2021].nc</em>) combining monthly releases of 32,300 particles initially distributed across the globe following global Mismanaged Plastic Waste (MPW) inputs. The particles are advected with OceanParcels (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-3571-2019"">Delandmeter, P and E van Sebille, 2019</a>) using ocean surface velocity, a wind drag coefficient of 1%, and a small random walk component with a uniform horizontal turbulent diffusion coefficient of K<sub>h</sub> = 1m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> representing unresolved turbulent motions in the ocean (see <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.667591"">Chassignet et al. 2021</a> for more details).</p>

<p><strong>Global oceanic current and atmospheric wind</strong></p>

<p>Ocean surface velocities are obtained from GOFS3.1, a global ocean reanalysis based on the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA; <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.667591/full#B7"">Chassignet et al., 2009</a>; <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/24862187?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents"">Metzger et al., 2014</a>). NCODA uses a three-dimensional (3D) variational scheme and assimilates satellite and altimeter observations as well as in-situ temperature and salinity measurements from moored buoys, Expendable Bathythermographs (XBTs), Argo floats (<a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35088-7_13"">Cummings and Smedstad, 2013</a>). Surface information is projected downward into the water column using Improved Synthetic Ocean Profiles (<a href=""https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA585251"">Helber et al., 2013</a>). The horizontal resolution and the temporal frequency for the GOF3.1 outputs are 1/12&deg; (8 km at the equator, 6 km at mid-latitudes) and 3-hourly, respectively. Details on the validation of the ocean circulation model are available in <a href=""https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1034517"">Metzger et al. (2017)</a>.</p>

<p>Wind velocities are obtained from JRA55, the Japanese 55-year atmospheric reanalysis. The JRA55, which spans from 1958 to the present, is the longest third-generation reanalysis that uses the full observing system and a 4D advanced data assimilation variational scheme. The horizontal resolution of JRA55 is about 55 km and the temporal frequency is 3-hourly (see <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146350031830235X?via%3Dihub"">Tsujino et al. (2018)</a> for more details).</p>

<p><strong>Marine Litter Sources</strong></p>

<p>The marine litter sources are obtained by combining MPW direct inputs from coastal regions, which are defined as areas within 50 km of the coastline (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-018-0212-7"">Lebreton and Andrady 2019</a>), and indirect inputs from inland regions via rivers (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15611"">Lebreton et al. 2017</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>File Format</strong></p>

<p>The locations (<em>lon</em>, <em>lat</em>), the corresponding weight (<em>tons</em>), and the source (<em>1</em>: land, <em>0</em>: river) associated with the 32,300 particles are described in the file <em>initial-location-global.csv</em>. The particle trajectories are regrouped into yearly files (<em>marine-litter-[2010&ndash;2021].nc</em>) which contain 12 monthly releases, resulting in a total of 387,600 trajectories per file. More precisely, in each of the yearly files, the first 32,300 lines contain the trajectories of particles released on January 1st, then lines 32,301&ndash;64,600 contain the trajectories of particles released on February 1st, and so on. The trajectories are recorded daily and are advected from their release until 2021-12-31, resulting in longer time series for earlier years of the dataset.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>When conditions change, unicellular organisms rewire their metabolism to sustain cell maintenance and cellular growth. Such rewiring may be understood as resource re-allocation under cellular constraints. Eukaryal cells contain metabolically active organelles such as mitochondria, competing for cytosolic space and resources, and the nature of the relevant cellular constraints remain to be determined for such cells. Here we present a comprehensive metabolic model of the yeast cell, based on its full metabolic reaction network extended with protein synthesis and degradation reactions. The model predicts metabolic fluxes and corresponding protein expression by constraining compartment-specific protein pools and maximising growth rate. Comparing model predictions with quantitative experimental data suggests that under glucose limitation, a mitochondrial constraint limits growth at the onset of ethanol formation - known as the Crabtree effect. Under sugar excess, however, a constraint on total cytosolic volume dictates overflow metabolism. Our comprehensive model thus identifies condition-dependent and compartment-specific constraints that can explain metabolic strategies and protein expression profiles from growth rate optimization, providing a framework to understand metabolic adaptation in eukaryal cells.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.h18931zjr,open,Replaying the evolutionary tape to investigate subgenome dominance in allopolyploid Brassica napus,"<p>Interspecific hybridization and allopolyploidization merge evolutionarily distinct parental genomes (subgenomes) into a single nucleus. A frequent observation is that one subgenome is ""dominant"" over the other subgenome, having a greater number of retained genes and being more highly expressed. Which subgenome becomes dominantly expressed in allopolyploids remains poorly understood. Here we ""replayed the evolutionary tape"" with six isogenic resynthesized<i> Brassica napus </i>(rapeseed) allopolyploid lines and investigated subgenome dominance patterns over the first ten generations post merger. We found that the same subgenome was consistently more dominantly expressed in all lines and generations and that &gt;70% of biased gene pairs showed the same dominance patterns across all lines and an <i>in silico</i> hybrid of the parents. Gene network analyses indicated an enrichment for network interactions and several biological functions for the <i>Brassica oleracea </i>derived 'BnC' subgenome biased pairs, but no enrichment was identified for <i>Brassica rapa</i> derived 'BnA' subgenome biased pairs. Furthermore, DNA methylation differences between subgenomes mirrored the observed gene expression bias towards the 'BnC' subgenome in all lines and generations. These methylation patterns were consistent with those previously associated with higher expression, but differ from proposed mechanisms from recent conceptual models and with observations in other polyploid systems that exhibit subgenome dominance. Many of these differences in gene expression and methylation were also found when comparing the progenitor genomes, suggesting subgenome dominance is partly related to parental genome differences rather than just a byproduct of allopolyploidization. These findings demonstrate that ""replaying the evolutionary tape"" in an allopolyploid results in largely repeatable and predictable subgenome expression dominance patterns, partly due to preexisting genetic differences among the parental species.</p>"
10.7280/D1595V,open,Annual Ice Velocity of the Greenland Ice Sheet (2001-2010),"<p>We derive surface ice velocity using data from 16 satellite sensors deployed by 6 different space agencies. The list of sensors and the year that they were used are listed in the following (Table S1). The SAR data are processed from raw to single look complex using the GAMMA processor (www.gamma-rs.ch). All measurements rely on consecutive images where the ice displacement is estimated from tracking or interferometry (Joughin et al. 1998, Michel and Rignot 1999, Mouginot et al. 2012). Surface ice motion is detected using a speckle tracking algorithm for SAR instruments and feature tracking for Landsat. The cross-correlation program for both SAR and optical images is ampcor from the JPL/Caltech repeat orbit interferometry package (ROI_PAC). We assembled a composite ice velocity mosaic at 150 m posting using our entire speed database as described in Mouginot et al. 2017 (Fig. 1A). The ice velocity maps are also mosaicked in annual maps at 150 m posting, covering July, 1st to June, 30th of the following year, i.e. centered on January, 1st (12) because a majority of historic data were acquired in winter season, hence spanning two calendar years.</p>

<p>We use Landsat-1&amp;2/MSS images between 1972 and 1976 and combine image pairs up to 1 year apart to measure the displacement of surface features between images as described in Dehecq et al., 2015 or Mouginot et al. 2017. We use the 1978 2-m orthorectified aerial images to correct the geolocation of Landsat-1 and -2 images (Korsgaard et al., 2016). Between 1984 and 1991, we processed Landsat-4&amp;5/TM image pairs acquired up to 1-year apart. Only few Landsat-4 and -5 images (~3%) needed geocoding refinement using the same 1978 reference as used previously. Between 1991 and 1998, we process radar images from the European ERS-1/2, with a repeat cycle varying from 3 to 36 days depending on the mission phase. Between 1999 and 2013, we use Landsat-7, ASTER, RADARSAT-1/2, ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR to determine surface velocity (Joughin et al., 2010; Howat, I. 2017; Rignot &amp; Mouginot, 2012). After 2013, we use Landsat-8, Sentinel-1a/b and RADARSAT-2 (Mouginot et al., 2017). All synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets are processed assuming surface parallel flow using the digital elevation model (DEM) from the Greenland Mapping Project (GIMP; Howat et al., 2014) and calibrated as described in Mouginot et al., 2012, 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Location: </strong>Australia's Antarctic continental stations: Davis, Mawson and Casey, East Antarctica; and subantarctic islands: Macquarie Island and Heard and McDonald Islands.</p>

<p><strong>Methods: </strong>Our study uses a novel machine-learning algorithm to predict which currently known hull fouling MIS could survive in shallow benthic ecosystems adjacent to Australian Antarctic research stations and subantarctic islands, where ship traffic is present. We used gradient boosted machine learning (XGBoost) with four important environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, nitrate and pH) to develop models of suitable environments for each potentially invasive species. We then used these models to determine if any Australia's three Antarctic research stations and two subantarctic islands could be environmentally suitable for MIS now and under two future climate scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Results: </strong>Most of the species were predicted to be unable to survive at any locations between now and the end of the century, however, four species were identified as potential current threats, and five as threats under future climate change. <em>Asterias amurensis</em> was identified as a potential threat to all locations.</p>

<p><strong>Main conclusions: </strong>This study suggests that the risk are very low, but plausible, that known hull fouling species could survive in the shallow benthic habitats near Australia's East Antarctica locations and suggest a precautionary approach is needed by way of surveillance and monitoring in this region, particularly if propagule pressure increases. Whilst some species could survive as adults in the region, their ability to reach these locations and undergo successful reproduction is considered unlikely based on current knowledge.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.3tf4mt4,open,"Data from: Synthesizing the effects of large, wild herbivore exclusion on ecosystem function","1. Wild large herbivores are declining worldwide. Despite extensive use of exclosure experiments to investigate herbivore impacts, there is little consensus on the effects of wild large herbivores on ecosystem function. 2. Of the ecosystem functions likely impacted, we reviewed the five most-studied in exclosure experiments: ecosystem resilience/resistance to disturbance, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, plant regeneration, and primary productivity. 3. Experimental data on large wild herbivores' effects on ecosystem functions were predominately derived from temperate grasslands (50% grasslands, 75% temperate zones), and experiments that may not be of adequate size (median size 400m2 despite excluding all experiments below 25m2) or duration (median duration 6 years) to capture ecosystem-scale responses to these low-density and wide-ranging taxa. 4. Wild herbivore removal frequently impacted ecosystem functions; for example, net carbon uptake increased by three times in some instances. However, the magnitude and direction of effects, even within a single function, were highly variable. 5. A focus on carbon cycling highlighted challenges in interpreting effects on a single function. While the effect of large herbivore exclusion on carbon cycling was slightly positive when its components (e.g. pools vs. fluxes of carbon) were aggregated, effects on individual components were variable and sometimes opposed. 6. Given modern declines in large wild herbivores, it is critical to understand their effects on ecosystem function. However, this synthesis highlights strong variability in direction, magnitude, and modifiers of these effects. Some variation is likely due to disparity in what components are used to describe a given function. For example, for the carbon cycle we identified eight distinctly meaningful components, which are not easily combined yet are potentially misrepresentative of the larger cycle when considered alone. However, much of the observed difference in responses likely reflects real ecological variability across complex systems. 7. To move towards a general predictive framework we must identify where variation in effect is due to methodological differences and where due to ecosystem context. Two critical steps forward are 1) additional quantitative synthetic analyses of large herbivores' effects on individual functions, and 2) improved, increased systematic exclosure research focusing on effects of large herbivores' exclusion on functions."
10.5061/dryad.326qs26,open,"Data from: A comprehensive mathematical model of motor unit pool organization, surface electromyography and force generation","Neuromuscular physiology is a vibrant research field that has recently seen exciting advances. Previous publications have focused on thorough analyses of particular aspects of neuromuscular physiology, yet an integration of the various novel findings into a single, comprehensive model is missing. In this article, we provide a unified description of a comprehensive mathematical model of surface electromyographic (EMG) measurements and the corresponding force signal in skeletal muscles, both consolidating and extending the results of previous studies regarding various components of the neuromuscular system.

The model comprises motor unit (MU) pool organization, recruitment and rate coding, intracellular action potential generation and the resulting EMG measurements, as well as the generated muscular force during voluntary isometric contractions. Mathematically, it consists of a large number of linear PDEs, ODEs, and various stochastic nonlinear relationships, some of which are solved analytically, others numerically. A parameterization of the electrical and mechanical components of the model is proposed that ensures a physiologically meaningful EMG-force relation in the simulated signals, in particular taking the continuous, size-dependent distribution of MU parameters into account. Moreover, we describe a novel nonlinear transformation of the common drive model input, which ensures that the model force output equals the desired target force. On a physiological level, this corresponds to adjusting the rate coding model to the force generating capabilities of the simulated muscle, while from a control theoretical point of view, this step is equivalent to an exact linearizing transformation of the controlled neuromuscular system. Finally, an alternative analytical formulation of the EMG model is proposed, which renders the physiological meaning of the model more clear and facilitates a mathematical proof that muscle fibers in this model at no point in time represent a net current source or sink.

A consistent description of a complete physiological model as presented here, including thorough justification of model component choices, will facilitate the use of these advanced models in future research. Results of a numerical simulation highlight the model's capability to reproduce many physiological effects observed in experimental measurements, and to produce realistic synthetic data that are useful for the validation of signal processing algorithms."

The study included 7 diets (2730 Kcal kg metabolizable energy and constant isoleucine at 0.72%) containing varying quantities of valine [0.72 (Control), 0.75, 0.78, 0.81, 0.84, 0.87 or 0.90%] x 7 replicates x 10 hens/replicate. Significance at P <u>&lt;</u> 0.05 and P &lt; 0.10 was determined. Level and week were significant for feed intake, egg production, and FCR; the interaction of level x week (L*W) was significant for feed intake and FCR. An isoleucine:valine of<sup> </sup>1.233 corresponding to 0.72% isoleucine and 0.87% valine produced the lowest FCR of 1.30 (a 2.26% decrease compared to the Control at 1.33 <u>+</u> 0.04) . All measurements for external egg quality, except shape index and eggshell thickness, were significant for level. Week was significant for all parameters except shell thickness; L*W was significant for external quality measurements except shape index and shell thickness. Level, week, and L*W were significant for internal egg quality measurements. Serum protein and H1 titer were significant for level. Various production, egg quality, and biochemical measurements were significantly different from the control (0.72% isoleucine and 0.72% valine) at 0.81 to 0.87% valine. Findings of this study will aid researchers and commercial producers in narrowing the range of isoleucine, valine, and leucine needed for effects on particular parameters. Knowledge gained from this and others studies will eventually lead to an understanding of synergistic and antagonistic effects of branched chain amino acids in feed for various genetic types of layers throughout their productive lifetime.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.2bvq83bkx,open,Diversification in evolutionary arenas – assessment and synthesis,"<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Understanding how and why rates of evolutionary diversification vary is a central issue in evolutionary biology, ecology and biogeography. The concept of adaptive radiation has attracted much interest, but is metaphorical and verbal in nature, making it difficult to quantitatively compare different evolutionary lineages or geographic regions. In addition, the causes of evolutionary stasis are relatively neglected. Here we review the central concepts in the evolutionary diversification literature and bring these together by proposing a general framework for studying rates of diversification and quantifying their underlying dynamics, which can be applied across clades and regions and across spatial and temporal scales. Our framework describes the diversification rate (<i>d</i>) as a function of the abiotic environment (<i>a</i>), the biotic environment (<i>b</i>) and clade-specific phenotypes or traits (<i>c</i>); thus <em>d ~ a, b, c</em>. We refer to the four components (<i>a</i>–<i>d</i>) and their interactions collectively as the 'Evolutionary Arena'. We outline analytical approaches to this conceptual model that may open up new avenues for research, and present a case study on conifers, for which we parameterise the general model. We also discuss three conceptual examples based on existing literature: the <i>Lupinus</i>radiation in the Andes in the context of emerging ecological opportunity and fluctuating connectivity due to climatic oscillations; oceanic island radiations in the context of archipelago isolation and island formation and erosion; and biotically driven radiations of the Mediterranean orchid genus <i>Ophrys</i>. The results of the conifer case study are consistent with the long-standing scenario that large niches, lack of competition, and high rates of niche evolution differentially promote diversification. The conceptual examples illustrate how using the synthetic Evolutionary Arena framework results in highlighting gaps in current knowledge, and thus help to identify and structure future directions for research on evolutionary radiations. In this way, the Evolutionary Arena framework promotes a more general understanding of variation in evolutionary rates by making quantitative results comparable between case studies, thereby allowing new syntheses of evolutionary and ecological processes to emerge.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>"
10.5281/zenodo.6131579,open,Myctobase,"<p>The global importance of mesopelagic fish is increasingly recognised, but they remain poorly studied. This is particularly true in the Southern Ocean, where mesopelagic fishes are both key predators and prey, but where the remote environment makes sampling challenging. Despite this, multiple national Antarctic research programs have undertaken regional sampling of mesopelagic fish over several decades. However, data are dispersed, and sampling methodologies often differ precluding comparisons and limiting synthetic analyses. Here, we have collated and standardized existing&nbsp;survey data of&nbsp;mesopelagic&nbsp;fishes into a circumpolar dataset called&nbsp;<em>Myctobase.&nbsp;</em>To date,&nbsp;<em>Myctobase&nbsp;</em>holds 17,491 occurrence and 11,190 abundance records from 4780 net hauls from 72 different research cruises.

10.5061/dryad.50jf82v,open,"Data from: ""The CarP‐N neutral Project"": removal, processing and reuse of invasive fish in local terrestrial conservation projects","1. Proliferation of problematic non-indigenous fish species is major biosecurity problem in many countries.
2. In Southern Hemisphere lowland rivers, species such as introduced common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) take advantage of nutrient rich conditions and a temperate climate and often dominate the fish biomass in invaded waterbodies.
3. These invasive organisms assimilate nutrients into their flesh and also release nutrients through re-suspension and defecation re-directing the pathway of energy transfer and use in aquatic systems.
4. We describe an invasive fish 'recycling' programme where a semi-automated trap selectively captures pest fish and transfers them to a thermophilic digester where bacteria efficiently process them into nutrient rich meal.
5. Developing products from invasive fish meal to support other conservation efforts while simultaneously providing a funding source to offset the costs of harvest and de-incentivise spread are key objectives.
6. We showcase two trials to substantiate our concept; a dune planting experiment where we demonstrate the transfer of processed invasive fish nutrient from an over-fertilised aquatic ecosystem to coastal sand dunes where nutrients are depleted but were formerly higher. We also illustrate the potential for using this locally derived recycled nutrient to replace imported synthetic fertiliser tablets typically used in dune planting.
7. The second trial demonstrates use of invasive fish as a lure in terrestrial trapping programmes for controlling other problematic invasive pests.
Synthesis and applications: We consider this concept to be a shift in restoration thinking whereby an aquatic biosecurity problem is being used to improve indigenous biodiversity outcomes in other ecosystems. We propose that this project is a useful vehicle to promote thought that more accurately embodies the concept of sustainability by being more cognisant of the traceability of nutrient flow from harvest and processing through to use within and between ecosystems. It illustrates alternate ways in which invasive products can be applied to these systems for positive environmental outcomes and to generate programme cost recovery. A similar philosophy should be applicable to problematic and abundant invasive species elsewhere, particularly where those organisms are susceptible to either point source control and or efficient mass harvest.08-Mar-2018"
10.5061/dryad.7c834db,open,Data from: Extreme site fidelity as an optimal strategy in an unpredictable and homogeneous environment,"1. Animal site fidelity structures space-use, population demography, and ultimately gene flow. Understanding the adaptive selection for site fidelity patterns provides a mechanistic understanding to both spatial and population processes. This can be achieved by linking space-use with environmental variability (spatial and temporal) and demographic parameters.  However, rarely is the environmental context that drives the selection for site fidelity behavior fully considered. 2. We use ecological theory to understand whether the spatial and temporal variability in breeding site quality can explain the site fidelity behavior and demographic patterns of Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus). We examined female site fidelity patterns across multiple spatial scales: proximity of consecutive year nest locations, space-use overlap within and across the breeding and brooding season, and fidelity to a breeding patch. We also examined the spatial and temporal variability in nest, chick, juvenile, and adult survival. 3. We found Gunnison sage-grouse to be site faithful to their breeding patch, area of use within the patch, and generally to where they nest, suggesting an `Always Stay' site fidelity strategy. This is an optimal evolutionary strategy when site quality is unpredictable. Further, we found limited spatial variability in survival within age groups, suggesting little demographic benefit to moving among patches. We suggest Gunnison sage-grouse site fidelity is driven by the unpredictability of predation in a relatively homogeneous environment, the lack of benefits and likely costs to moving across landscape patches and leaving known lek and breeding/brooding areas. 4. Space use and demography are commonly studied separately. More so, site fidelity patterns are rarely framed in the context of ecological theory, beyond questions related to the win-stay:lose-switch rule. To move beyond describing patterns and understand the adaptive selection driving species movements and their demographic consequences requires integrating movement, demography, and environmental variability in a synthetic framework. 5. Site fidelity theory provides a coherent framework to simultaneously investigate the spatial and population ecology of animal populations. Using it to frame ecological questions will lead to a more mechanistic understanding of animal movement, spatial population structuring, and meta-population dynamics."

10.5061/dryad.vmcvdncvj,open,Data from: Opposite effects of nutrient enrichment and an invasive snail on the growth of invasive and native macrophytes,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Many ecosystems are now co-invaded by alien plant and herbivore species. The evolutionary <span>naivety</span> of native plants to alien herbivores can make the plants more susceptible to detrimental effects of herbivory than co-occurring invasive plants, in accordance with the apparent competition hypothesis. Moreover, the invasional meltdown hypothesis predicts that in multiply invaded ecosystems, invasive species can facilitate each other's impacts on native communities. Although there is growing empirical support for these hypotheses, facilitative interactions between invasive plants and herbivores remain underexplored in aquatic ecosystems. Many freshwater ecosystems are co-invaded by aquatic macrophytes and mollusks and simultaneously experience nutrient enrichment. However, the interactive effects of these ecological processes on native macrophyte communities remain an underexplored area. To test these effects, we performed a freshwater mesocosm experiment in which we grew a synthetic native community of three macrophyte species under two levels of invasion by an alien macrophyte <em>Myriophyllum aquaticum</em> (invasion vs. no-invasion) and fully crossed with two levels of nutrient enrichment (enrichment vs. no-enrichment) and herbivory by an invasive snail <em>Pomacea canaliculata</em> (herbivory vs. no-herbivory). In line with the invasional meltdown and apparent competition hypotheses, we found that the proportional above-ground biomass yield of the invasive macrophyte, relative to that of the native macrophyte community, was significantly greater in the presence of the invasive herbivore. Evidence of a reciprocal facilitative effect of the invasive macrophyte on the invasive herbivore is provided by the results showing that the herbivore produced greater egg biomass in the presence than in the absence of <em>M. aquaticum</em>. However, nutrient enrichment reduced the mean proportional above-ground biomass yield of the invasive macrophyte. Our results suggested that herbivory by invader <em>P. canaliculata</em> may enhance invasiveness of <em>M. aquaticum</em>. However, nutrient enrichment of habitats that already harbor <em>M. aquaticum</em> may slow down invasive spread of the macrophyte. Broadly, our study underscores the significance of considering several factors and their interactions when assessing the impact of invasive species, especially considering that many habitats experience co-invasion by plants and herbivores and simultaneously undergo various other disturbances, including nutrient enrichment. </p>"
10.5061/dryad.bg79cnp78,open,A comprehensive index for threatened biodiversity valuation,"<p><span>We present a new comprehensive index for mapping the relative conservation value of threatened biodiversity. The index is based on explicit criteria to (1) select threatened species according to regional government responsibility for species' conservation; (2) combine species' presence by means of weighting factors based on differences in threat status, sensitivity to disturbance, functional role, and amount of knowledge; and (3) map species distributions at the scale of 1 km×1 km UTM squares or lower from the information available. We tested the performance of the index in the forest of Andalusia (southern Spain), an extensive European region of 87,268 km2, with 43,864 km<sup>2</sup> (ca. 50%) classified as forest habitats. All species included in the Annexes of the European Birds and Habitats Directives inhabiting the target area, plus the regionally endemic species either 'Critically Endangered' or 'Endangered' not (yet) covered by the Directives were selected. The final list included 224 species: 81 plants, 76 birds, 31 mammals, 22 arthropods, six reptiles, five amphibians, and three mollusks. Fine-scale distribution maps were available for 108 species (48%). The remaining maps were downscaled from published 10 km×10 km UTM maps using knowledge on species' habitat requirements and land-use maps. We overlapped the fine-scale maps with the 86,546 forest tiles of the Andalusian Forest Map and weighted presences by a factor of relative conservation estimated for each species to obtain an index of the relative conservation of each forest tile. Index values were higher in protected areas, and in different forest habitats according to expected numbers of endangered species. Index values were correlated with the existence value of threatened species, but the index underestimate existence values especially for the most valuable tiles. The proposed index allows mapping the relative conservation value of threatened biodiversity by integrating knowledge on all threatened species into a single variable. Integration is based on explicit methodological criteria for species selection, combination of relative conservation values, and estimation of downscaled maps. Accurate mapping and synthetic summary of compulsory data on the conservation status of all species present in a territory advise its extended use for threatened biodiversity valuation in both Europe and elsewhere.</span></p>"

10.5061/dryad.59zw3r23d,open,Data from Soil chemistry turned upside down: a meta-analysis of invasive earthworm effects on soil chemical properties,"<p>Recent studies have shown that invasive earthworms can dramatically reduce native biodiversity, both above and below the ground. <a name=""_Hlk9515878"">However, we still lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind these changes, such as whether earthworm effects on soil chemical properties drive such relationships</a>. Here, we investigated the effects of invasive earthworms on soil chemical properties (pH, water content, and the stocks and fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) by conducting a meta-analysis. Invasive earthworms generally increased soil pH, indicating that the removal of organic layers and the upward transport of more base-rich mineral soil caused a shift in soil pH. Moreover, earthworms significantly decreased soil water content, suggesting that the burrowing activities of earthworms may have increased water infiltration of and/or increased evapo-transpiration from soil. Notably, invasive earthworms had opposing effects on organic and mineral soil for carbon and nitrogen stocks, with decreases in organic, and increases in mineral soil. Nitrogen fluxes were higher in mineral soil, whereas fluxes in organic soil were not significantly affected by the presence of invasive earthworms, indicating that earthworms mobilize and redistribute nutrients among soil layers and increase overall nitrogen loss from the soil. Invasive earthworm effects on element stocks increased with ecological group richness only in organic soil. Earthworms further decreased ammonium stocks with negligible effects on nitrate stocks in organic soil, whereas they increased nitrate stocks but not ammonium stocks in mineral soil. Notably, all of these results were consistent across forest and grassland ecosystems underlining the generality of our findings. However, we found some significant differences between studies that were conducted in the field (observational and experimental settings) and in the lab, such as that the effects on soil pH decreased from field to lab settings, calling for a careful interpretation of lab findings. Our meta-analysis provides strong empirical evidence that earthworm invasion may lead to substantial changes in soil chemical properties and element cycling in soil. Furthermore, our results can help explain the dramatic effects of invasive earthworms on native biodiversity, e.g., shifts towards the dominance of grass species over herbaceous ones, as shown by recent meta-analyses.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.08kprr532,open,Rewetting does not return drained fen peatlands to their old selves,"<p>Peatlands, in particular groundwater-fed fens of the temperate zone, have been drained for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction for a long time and on a large scale. Drainage turns peatlands from a carbon and nutrient sink into a respective source, diminishes water regulation capacity at the landscape scale, causes continuous surface height loss and destroys their typical biodiversity. Over the last decades, drained peatlands have been rewetted for biodiversity restoration and, as it strongly decreases greenhouse gas emissions, also for climate protection.</p>

<p>With the dataset published here, we quantified restoration success by comparing 320 rewetted fen peatland sites to 243 near-natural peatland sites of similar origin across temperate Europe with regards to biodiversity (vegetation), ecosystem functioning (hydrology, geochemistry) and land cover characteristics based on remote sensing.</p>

<p>Vegetation data comes as species-specific cover values. Hydrology data covers on average 2.3 years and minimally one full year and comes as median, minimum, and maximum water table depth. Geochemistry consists of pH and electrical conductivity of the pore water (0-60 cm), bulk density and organic matter content of the top soil layer (0-30 cm), all sampled in summer for all sites included here alongside the vegetation data sampling. Land cover characteristics contain 208 spectral-temporal metrics for a full annual time series of Copernicus Sentinel-2 A/B data for 2018.</p>"
10.7280/D1GW91,open,Annual Ice Velocity of the Greenland Ice Sheet (1991-2000),"<p>We derive surface ice velocity using data from 16 satellite sensors deployed by 6 different space agencies. The list of sensors is given in the Table S1. The SAR data are processed from raw to single look complex using the GAMMA processor (www.gamma-rs.ch). All measurements rely on consecutive images where the ice displacement is estimated from tracking or interferometry (Joughin et al. 1998, Michel and Rignot 1999, Mouginot et al. 2012). Surface ice motion is detected using a speckle tracking algorithm for SAR instruments and feature tracking for Landsat. The cross-correlation program for both SAR and optical images is ampcor from the JPL/Caltech repeat orbit interferometry package (ROI_PAC). We assemble a composite ice velocity mosaic at 150 m posting using our entire speed database as described in Mouginot et al. 2017 (Fig. 1A). The ice velocity maps are also mosaicked in annual maps at 150 m posting, covering July, 1st to June, 30th of the following year, i.e. centered on January, 1st (12) because a majority of historic data were acquired in winter season, hence spanning two calendar years.<br>
We use Landsat-1&amp;2/MSS images between 1972 and 1976 and combine image pairs up to 1 years apart to measure the displacement of surface features between images as described in Dehecq et al., 2015 or Mouginot et al. 2017. We use the 1978 2-m orthorectified aerial images to correct the geolocation of Landsat-1 and -2 images (Korsgaard et al., 2016). Between 1984 and 1991, we process Landsat-4&amp;5/TM image pairs acquired up to 1-year apart. Only few Landsat-4 and -5 images (~3%) needed geocoding refinement using the same 1978 reference as used previously. Between 1991 and 1998, we process radar images from the European ERS-1/2, with a repeat cycle varying from 3 to 36 days depending on the mission phase. Between 1999 and 2013, we used Landsat-7, ASTER, RADARSAT-1/2, ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR to determine surface velocity (Joughin et al., 2010; Howat, I. 2017; Rignot and Mouginot, 2012). After 2013, we use Landsat-8, Sentinel-1a/b and RADARSAT-2 (Mouginot et al., 2017). All synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets are processed assuming surface parallel flow using the digital elevation model (DEM) from the Greenland Mapping Project (GIMP; Howat et al., 2014) and calibrated as described in Mouginot et al., 2012, 2017. Data were provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), the EU Copernicus program (through ESA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). SAR data acquisitions were coordinated by the Polar Space Task Group (PSTG). Errors are estimated based on sensor resolution and time lapse between consecutive images as described in Mouginot et al. 2017. </p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>In this study, novel mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were synthesized by adding metal organic frameworks (MOFs) (UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>) to pristine and sulfonated polyethersulfone (PES). The differing synthetic method resulting in MMM where additives were grafted to the matrix polymer, or formed a natural interface, allowing the impact of these MMM features to be investigated. The composite membranes were characterised by FTIR, PXRD, water contact angle, porosity, pore size, etc. Membrane performance was investigated by water permeation flux, flux recovery ratio, fouling resistance and anti-fouling performance. The stability test was also conducted for all the prepared mixed matrix membranes. A higher reduction in the water contact angle was observed after adding both MOFs to the PES and sulfonated PES membranes compared to pristine PES membranes. An enhancement in membrane performance was observed by embedding the MOFs into PES membrane matrix, with flux increased remarkably (565 LMH for PES+UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> at 5% loading and 487.1 LMH for SPES-UiO-66(10% binding) while the BSA rejection was still kept at a high level. By adding the MOFs into PES matrix, the flux recovery ratio was increased greatly (more than 99% for most mixed matrix membranes). The mixed matrix membranes showed higher resistance to protein adsorption compared to pristine PES membranes. After immersing the membranes in water for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months, both MOFs were stable and retained their structure. This study indicates that UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> are great candidates for designing long-term stable mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for applications in water and wastewater treatment.</p>"

Please find the abstract below.</p>

<p><strong>Background: </strong>Cellodextrin phosphorylase (CdP; EC 2.4.1.49) catalyzes the iterative &beta;-1,4-glycosylation of cellobiose using &alpha;-D-glucose 1-phosphate as the donor substrate. Cello-oligosaccharides (COS) with a degree of polymerization (DP) of up to 6 are soluble while those of larger DP self-assemble into solid cellulose material. The soluble COS have attracted considerable attention for their use as dietary fibers that offer a selective prebiotic function. An efficient synthesis of soluble COS requires good control over the DP of the products formed. A mathematical model of the iterative enzymatic glycosylation would be important to facilitate target-oriented process development.<br>
<strong>Results: </strong>A detailed time-course analysis of the formation of COS products from cellobiose (25 mM, 50 mM) and &alpha;-D-glucose 1-phosphate (10&ndash;100 mM) was performed using the CdP from <em>Clostridium cellulosi</em>. A mechanism-based, Michaelis&ndash;Menten type mathematical model was developed to describe the kinetics of the iterative enzymatic glycosylation of cellobiose. The mechanistic model was combined with an empirical description of the DP-dependent self-assembly of the COS into insoluble cellulose. The hybrid model thus obtained was used for kinetic parameter determination from time-course fits performed with constraints derived from initial rate data. The fitted hybrid model provided excellent description of the experimental dynamics of the COS in the DP range 3&ndash;6 and also accounted for the insoluble product formation. The hybrid model was suitable to disentangle the complex relationship between the process conditions used (i.e., substrate concentration, donor/acceptor ratio, reaction time) and the reaction output obtained (i.e., yield and composition of soluble COS). Model application to a window-of-operation analysis for the synthesis of soluble COS was demonstrated on the example of a COS mixture enriched in DP 4.<br>
<strong>Conclusions:</strong> The hybrid model of CdP-catalyzed iterative glycosylation is an important engineering tool to study and optimize the biocatalytic synthesis of soluble COS. The kinetic modeling approach used here can be of a general interest to be applied to other iteratively catalyzed enzymatic reactions of synthetic importance.</p>"

However, not much is known about the genetic background and variability of the local sheep populations. Therefore, our aims were to provide a characterization of the population structure and genetic relations within the Kyrgyz sheep breeds and to study their genetic connections with the global sheep breeds using SNP analysis. Samples of the Alai (n=31), Gissar (n=30), Kyrgyz coarse wool (n=13), Aykol (n=31), and Tien-Shan (n=24) breeds were genotyped with the OvineSNP50 BeadChip or the <span>Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip </span>(Illumina Inc., USA). The measure of inbreeding based on runs of homozygosity showed a minimum value in the Aykol breed (F<sub>ROH</sub> = 0.034), while the maximum was found in the Alai breed (F<sub>ROH</sub> = 0.071). Short ROH segments (ROH≤4Mb) were predominant in all breeds. Long ROH segments (ROH&gt;16Mb) were absent in the Gissar breed. The Gissar and Aykol breeds had the highest values of the effective population sizes estimated for five generations ago (<i>Ne<sub>5</sub>=</i>660 and 563), whereas the Alai and Kyrgyz coarse wool displayed lower values (<i>Ne<sub>5</sub> </i>=176 and 128, respectively). The synthetic origin of the Aykol breed was clearly evidenced by all analyses applied. Based on the network and admixture analyses of the Kyrgyz and global sheep breeds, the Tien-Shan and the Russian semi-fine wool breeds demonstrated a common ancestry that most likely is due to a contribution of the Lincoln breed. The Gissar, Aykol and Kyrgyz coarse wool breeds showed a genetic background predominating in sheep populations from Iran and China whereas the Alai demonstrated the different ancestry type. The revealed admixture patterns probably resulted from the exchange and trade during the era of the Great Silk Road, which partly overlapped with historical and archeological findings.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.wwpzgmsgf,open,Data from: Gut microbiome critically impacts PCB-induced changes in metabolic fingerprints and the hepatic transcriptome in mice,"<p class=""western""><span><span><span>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitously detected in the environment and have been linked to metabolic diseases. The liver serves as a central hub for the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites. Gut dysbiosis is recognized as a critical regulator of disease susceptibility, however, little is known regarding how PCBs and gut microbiome interact to modulate the interface between xenobiotic and intermediary metabolism. We hypothesized that the gut microbiome regulates PCBs-mediated changes in the metabolic fingerprints and hepatic transcriptome. Ninety-day-old female conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were orally exposed to the PCB Fox River Mixture (synthetic PCB mixture, 6 or 30 mg/kg) or corn oil (vehicle control, 10 ml/kg), once daily for 3 consecutive days. Organs were collected 24 hours after the final dose. RNA-Seq was conducted on liver, and endogenous aqueous metabolites (amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides) were measured in liver and serum by LC-MS. The primary factor in clustering the transcriptomic and metabolomic signatures within the same exposure was by enterotype. The numbers of PCB-regulated genes were higher in CV than in GF conditions. The prototypical target genes of the major xenobiotic-sensing transcription factors AhR, PXR, and CAR were more readily up-regulated by PCBs in CV than in GF conditions, indicating the effect of PCBs on the hepatic transcriptome act partly through the gut microbiome. Xenobiotic and steroid metabolism pathways were up-regulated, whereas response to incorrect proteins pathway was down-regulated by PCBs in a gut microbiome-dependent manner. At the high PCB dose, NADP and arginine appear to interact with drug-metabolizing enzymes (Cyp1-3 family, DhcR7, and Nqo1), which are highly correlated with <i>Anaerotruncus</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> in CV mice, providing a novel explanation of gut-liver interaction in toxicant exposures. In GF exposure groups, hepatic glucose was down-regulated, whereas fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate were up-regulated, indicating increased glucose utilization potentiated by lack of gut microbiota. Through querying the LINCS L1000 chemical database, Enrichr predicted that therapeutic drugs targeting the anti-inflammatory and ER stress pathways are potential remedies to mitigate PCB toxicity. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that habitation of the gut microbiota drives PCBs-mediated hepatic responses, possibly due to crosstalk between gut and liver. </span></span></span></p>"

10.5281/zenodo.5013687,open,Identification of a Pathway for Electron Uptake in Shewanella oneidensis,"<p>Data for figures for &quot;Identification of a Pathway for Electron&nbsp;Uptake in&nbsp;<em>Shewanella oneidensis</em>&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Extracellular electron transfer (EET) could enable electron uptake into microbial metabolism for the synthesis of complex, energy dense organic molecules from CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and renewable electricity<sup>1-6</sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup>. Theoretically EET could do this with an efficiency comparable to H<sub>2</sub>-oxidation<sup>7,8</sup>&nbsp;but without the need for a&nbsp;volatile intermediate&nbsp;and the problems it causes for scale up<sup>9</sup>. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the mechanism and genetics of electron uptake. For example, studies of electron uptake in electroactive microbes have shown a role for the Mtr EET complex in the electroactive microbe&nbsp;<em>Shewanella oneidensis</em>&nbsp;MR-1<sup>10-14</sup>, though there is substantial variation in the magnitude of effect deletion of these genes has depending on the terminal electron acceptor used. This speaks to the potential for novel and/or differentially utilized genes involved in electron uptake. To address this, we screened gene disruption mutants for 3,667 genes, representing &asymp; 99% of all non-essential genes, from the&nbsp;<em>S. oneidensis</em>whole genome knockout collection using a redox dye oxidation assay. Confirmation of electron uptake using electrochemical testing allowed us to identify five genes from&nbsp;<em>S.</em><em>&nbsp;oneidensis</em>&nbsp;that are indispensable for electron uptake from a cathode. Knockout of each gene eliminates extracellular electron uptake, yet in four of the five cases produces no significant defect in electron donation to an anode. This result highlights both distinct electron uptake components and an electronic connection between aerobic and anaerobic electron transport chains that allow electrons from the reversible EET machinery to be coupled to different respiratory processes in&nbsp;<em>S. oneidensis</em>. Homologs to these genes across many different genera suggesting that electron uptake by EET coupled to respiration could be widespread. These gene discoveries provide a foundation for: studying this phenotype in exotic metal-oxidizing microbes, genetic optimization of electron uptake in&nbsp;<em>S. oneidensis</em>; and genetically engineering electron uptake into a highly tractable host like&nbsp;<em>E. coli&nbsp;</em>to complement recent advances in synthetic CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;fixation<sup>15</sup>.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.4701174,open,Vision-based Neural Scene Representations for Spacecraft dataset,"<p>Real space datasets are scarce and often come with limited metadata to supervise the training of learning algorithms. Using synthetic data allows us to produce a large dataset in a controlled environment which eases the production of annotations. We generate the data with the 3D engine Unity using models of two different satellites: a CubeSat and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite.</p>

<p>CubeSat is a small satellite based on a 3U CubeSat platform. It is a rectangular cuboid shaped of 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.9 m. Its main structure is made of aluminum and black PCB panels on its sides. For this satellite model, we place the camera at 1 meter to render the datasets&#39; images. The near and far bounds are fixed at 0.1 m and 2 m.</p>

<p>SMOS has a more complicated and elongated shape. The main platform has a cubic shape of 0.9 x 0.9 x 1.0 m with solar panels attached on two sides, each 6.5 m long. The payload is a 3-branch antenna of 3 meters each placed at 60 degrees. The structure is covered by golden and silvered foils, which are highly reflective materials. For this satellite model, we place the camera at 10 meters to render the images. The near and far bounds are fixed at 3 m and 17 m due to the solar panel length.</p>

<p>The scene is composed of one satellite, SMOS or CubeSat, with one directional light source fixed with regards to the targeted object. The images are rendered using viewpoints sampled on a full sphere with a unified black background. The images are rendered with a resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels. For each image, the distance to the camera, azimuth and elevation angles are saved as metadata and a depth map is rendered for testing the predicted shape.</p>

<p>We generate training and validation sets containing resp. 5, 10, 50 and 100 images to evaluate the model during training. We also generate a test set of 100 images from different viewing directions than the ones used in the training and validation sets. This common test set will be used to evaluate our models regardless of the number of training images used.</p>"

Every scene is rendered from a set of 3 cameras, each positioned relative to the track for optimal 3D reconstruction of the rail profile. The set of cameras is translated across the 100-meter length of tangent (straight) track to yield a total of 1,995 camera views. Photorealistic lighting of each of the 40 scenes is achieved with the implementation of high-definition, high dynamic range (HDR) environmental textures. Additional variation is introduced in the form of camera focal lengths, random noise for the camera location and rotation parameters and shader modifications of the rail profile. Representative track geometry data is used to generate random and unique vertical alignment data for the rail profile for every scene. This primary, synthetic dataset is augmented by a smaller image collection consisting of 320 manually annotated photographs for improved segmentation performance. The specular rail profile represents the most challenging component for MVS reconstruction algorithms, pipelines and neural network architectures, increasing the ambiguity and complexity of the data distribution. RailEnV-PASMVS represents an application specific dataset for railway engineering, against the backdrop of existing datasets available in the field of computer vision, providing the precision required for novel research applications in the field of transportation engineering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Steps to reproduce</strong></p>

<p>The open source Blender software suite (https://www.blender.org/) was used to generate the dataset, with the entire pipeline developed using the exposed Python API interface. The camera trajectory is kept fixed for all 40 scenes, except for small perturbations introduced in the form of random noise to increase the camera variation. The camera intrinsic information was initially exported as a single CSV file (<strong>scene.csv</strong>) for every scene, from which the camera information files were generated; this includes the focal length (<strong>focalLengthmm</strong>), image sensor dimensions (<strong>pixelDimensionX</strong>, <strong>pixelDimensionY</strong>), position, coordinate vector (<strong>vectC</strong>) and rotation vector (<strong>vectR</strong>). The STL model files, as provided in this data repository, were exported directly from Blender, such that the geometry/scenes can be reproduced. The data processing below is written for a Python implementation, transforming the information from Blender&#39;s coordinate system into universal rotation (<strong>R_world2cv</strong>) and translation (<strong>T_world2cv</strong>) matrices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code class=""language-python"">import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R

#The intrinsic matrix K is constructed using the following formulation:
focalLengthPixel = focalLengthmm x pixelDimensionX / sensorWidthmm
K = [[focalLengthPixel, 0, dimX/2],
      [0, focalPixel, dimY/2],
      [0, 0, 1]]

#The rotation vector as provided by Blender was first transformed to a rotation matrix:
r = R.from_euler('xyz', vectR, degrees=True)
matR = r.as_matrix()

#Transpose the rotation matrix, to find matrix from the WORLD to BLENDER coordinate system:
R_world2bcam = np.transpose(matR)

#The matrix describing the transformation from BLENDER to CV/STANDARD coordinates is:
R_bcam2cv = np.array([[1, 0, 0],
                              [0, -1, 0],
                              [0, 0, -1]])

#Thus the representation from WORLD to CV/STANDARD coordinates is:
R_world2cv = R_bcam2cv.dot(R_world2bcam)

#The camera coordinate vector requires a similar transformation moving from BLENDER to WORLD coordinates:
T_world2bcam = -1 * R_world2bcam.dot(vectC)
T_world2cv = R_bcam2cv.dot(T_world2bcam)</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The resulting <strong>R_world2cv</strong> and <strong>T_world2cv</strong> matrices are written to the camera information file using exactly the same format as that of <a href=""https://github.com/YoYo000/BlendedMVS"">BlendedMVS developed by Dr. Yao</a>. The original rotation and translation information can be found by following the process in reverse. Note that additional steps were required to convert from Blender&#39;s unique coordinate system to that of OpenCV; this ensures universal compatibility in the way that the camera intrinsic and extrinsic information is provided.</p>

<p>Equivalent GPS information is provided (<strong>gps.csv</strong>), whereby the local coordinate frame is transformed into equivalent GPS information, centered around the <a href=""https://www.up.ac.za/eng4"">Engineering 4.0 campus, University of Pretoria</a>, South Africa.

10.7280/D1MM37,open,Annual Ice Velocity of the Greenland Ice Sheet (1972-1990),"<p>We derive surface ice velocity using data from 16 satellite sensors deployed by 6 different space agencies. The list of sensors and the year that they were used are listed in the following (Table S1). The SAR data are processed from raw to single look complex using the GAMMA processor (www.gamma-rs.ch). All measurements rely on consecutive images where the ice displacement is estimated from tracking or interferometry (Joughin et al. 1998, Michel and Rignot 1999, Mouginot et al. 2012). Surface ice motion is detected using a speckle tracking algorithm for SAR instruments and feature tracking for Landsat. The cross-correlation program for both SAR and optical images is ampcor from the JPL/Caltech repeat orbit interferometry package (ROI_PAC). We assembled a composite ice velocity mosaic at 150 m posting using our entire speed database as described in Mouginot et al. 2017 (Fig. 1A). The ice velocity maps are also mosaicked in annual maps at 150 m posting, covering July, 1st to June, 30th of the following year, i.e. centered on January, 1st (12) because a majority of historic data were acquired in winter season, hence spanning two calendar years.</p>

<p>We use Landsat-1&amp;2/MSS images between 1972 and 1976 and combine image pairs up to 1 years apart to measure the displacement of surface features between images as described in Dehecq et al., 2015 or Mouginot et al. 2017. We use the 1978 2-m orthorectified aerial images to correct the geolocation of Landsat-1 and -2 images (Korsgaard et al., 2016). Between 1984 and 1991, we processed Landsat-4&amp;5/TM image pairs acquired up to 1-year apart. Only few Landsat-4 and -5 images (~3%) needed geocoding refinement using the same 1978 reference as used previously. Between 1991 and 1998, we process radar images from the European ERS-1/2, with a repeat cycle varying from 3 to 36 days depending on the mission phase. Between 1999 and 2013, we use Landsat-7, ASTER, RADARSAT-1/2, ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR to determine surface velocity (Joughin et al., 2010; <span>Howat, I.</span> 2017; Rignot &amp; Mouginot, 2012). After 2013, we use Landsat-8, Sentinel-1a/b and RADARSAT-2 (Mouginot et al., 2017). All synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets are processed assuming surface parallel flow using the digital elevation model (DEM) from the Greenland Mapping Project (GIMP; Howat et al., 2014) and calibrated as described in Mouginot et al., 2012, 2017.</p>

<p>Data were provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) the EU Copernicus program (through ESA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). SAR data acquisition were coordinated by the Polar Space Task Group (PSTG).</p>

10.5061/dryad.m7n455k0,open,Data from: Best practices for justifying fossil calibrations,"Our ability to correlate biological evolution with climate change, geological evolution, and other historical patterns is essential to understanding the processes that shape biodiversity. Combining data from the fossil record with molecular phylogenetics represents an exciting synthetic approach to this challenge. The first molecular divergence dating analysis (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1962) was based on a measure of the amino acid differences in the hemoglobin molecule; with replacement rates established (calibrated) using inaccurate paleontological age estimates from textbooks (e.g., Dodson 1955). Since that time, the amount of molecular sequence data has increased dramatically, affording ever-greater opportunities to apply molecular divergence approaches to fundamental problems in evolutionary biology. To capitalize on these opportunities, increasingly sophisticated divergence dating methods have been, and continue to be, developed. In contrast, comparatively little attention has been devoted to critically assessing the paleontological and associated geological data used in divergence dating analyses. The lack of rigorous protocols for assigning calibrations based on fossils raises serious questions about the credibility of divergence dating results (Shaul and Graur 2002; Brochu et al. 2004; Graur and Martin 2004; Hedges and Kumar 2004; Reisz and Muller 2004a,b; Theodor, 2004; van Tuinen and Hadly 2004a,b; van Tuinen et al. 2004; Benton and Donoghue 2007; Donoghue and Benton 2007; Parham and Irmis 2008; Ksepka 2009; Benton et al. 2009; Heads 2011). The assertion that incorrect calibrations will negatively influence divergence-dating studies is not controversial. Attempts to identify incorrect calibrations through the use of a posteriori methods are available (e.g., Near and Sanderson 2004; Near et al. 2005; Rutschman et al. 2007; Marshall 2008; Pyron 2010; Dornburg et al. 2011). These methods avoid the need for molecular systematists to interpret the unfamiliar and often obscure literature of paleontology, stratigraphy, and geochronology. Most a posteriori methods assess the consistency among calibrations on different nodes and reject inconsistent calibrations. However, consistency among fossil calibrations (or lack thereof) may be the consequence of temporal or geographical biases in the rock record. For example, all dates could be equally underestimated because of missing rock units or missing fossils in a particular time interval. In these instances, cross validation could lead to the rejection of calibrations that provide a better approximation of divergence times (Marshall 2008; Benton et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2009). We do not deny that a posteriori methods are a useful means of evaluating calibrations, but there can be no substitute for a priori assessment of the veracity of paleontological data."
10.5061/dryad.634d24h,open,"Data from: The sugarcane mitochondrial genome: assembly, phylogenetics and transcriptomics","<p><strong>Background:</strong> Chloroplast genomes provide insufficient phylogenetic information to distinguish between closely related sugarcane cultivars, due to the recent origin of many cultivars and the conserved sequence of the chloroplast. In comparison, the mitochondrial genome of plants is much larger and more plastic and could contain increased phylogenetic signals. We assembled a consensus reference mitochondrion with Illumina TruSeq synthetic long reads and ONT MinION long reads. Based on this assembly we also analyzed the mitochondrial transcriptomes of sugarcane and sorghum and improved the annotation of the sugarcane mitochondrion as compared with other species.</p>

<p><strong>Methods</strong>: Mitochondrial genomes were assembled from genomic read pools using a bait and assemble methodology. The mitogenome was exhaustively annotated using BLAST and transcript datasets were mapped with HISAT2 prior to analysis with the Integrated Genome Viewer.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: The sugarcane mitochondrion is comprised of two independent chromosomes, for which there is no evidence of recombination. Based on the reference assembly from the sugarcane cultivar SP80-3280 the mitogenomes of four additional cultivars (R570, LCP85-384, RB72343 and SP70-1143) were assembled (with the SP70-1143 assembly utilizing both genomic and transcriptomic data and the R570 data based on MinION assembly). We demonstrate that the sugarcane plastome is completely transcribed and we assembled the chloroplast genome of SP80-3280 using transcriptomic data only. Phylogenomic analysis using mitogenomes allow closely related sugarcane cultivars to be distinguished and supports the discrimination between <em>Saccharum officinarum</em> and <em>Saccharum cultum</em> as modern sugarcane's female parent. From whole chloroplast comparisons, we demonstrate that modern sugarcane arose from a limited number of S. cultum female founders. Transcriptomic and spliceosomal analyses reveal that the two chromosomes of the sugarcane mitochondrion are combined at the transcript level and that splice sites occur more frequently within gene coding regions than without. We reveal one confirmed and one potential cytoplasmic male sterility factor in the sugarcane mitochondrion, both of which are transcribed</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Transcript processing in the sugarcane mitochondrion is highly complex with diverse splice events, the majority of which span the two chromosomes. PolyA baited transcripts are consistent with the use of polyadenylation for transcript degradation. For the first time we annotate two cytoplasmic male sterility factors within the sugarcane mitochondrion and demonstrate that sugarcane possesses all the molecular machinery required for cytoplasmic male sterility and rescue. A mechanism of cross-chromosomal splicing based on guide RNAs is proposed. We also demonstrate that mitogenomes can be used to perform phylogenomic studies on sugarcane cultivars.</p>"

10.5061/dryad.bh276,open,Data from: Transcriptome analysis of 20 taxonomically related benzylisoquinoline alkaloid-producing plants,"Background: Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) represent a diverse class of plant specialized metabolites sharing a common biosynthetic origin beginning with tyrosine. Many BIAs have potent pharmacological activities, and plants accumulating them boast long histories of use in traditional medicine and cultural practices. The decades-long focus on a select number of plant species as model systems has allowed near or full elucidation of major BIA pathways, including those of morphine, sanguinarine and berberine. However, this focus has created a dearth of knowledge surrounding non-model species, which also are known to accumulate a wide-range of BIAs but whose biosynthesis is thus far entirely unexplored. Further, these non-model species represent a rich source of catalyst diversity valuable to plant biochemists and emerging synthetic biology efforts. Results: In order to access the genetic diversity of non-model plants accumulating BIAs, we selected 20 species representing 4 families within the Ranunculales. RNA extracted from each species was processed for analysis by both 1) Roche GS-FLX Titanium and 2) Illumina GA/HiSeq platforms, generating a total of 40 deep-sequencing transcriptome libraries. De novo assembly, annotation and subsequent full-length coding sequence (CDS) predictions indicated greater success for most species using the Illumina-based platform. Assembled data for each transcriptome were deposited into an established web-based BLAST portal (www.phytometasyn.ca) to allow public access. Homology-based mining of libraries using BIA-biosynthetic enzymes as queries yielded ~850 gene candidates potentially involved in alkaloid biosynthesis. Expression analysis of these candidates was performed using inter-library FPKM normalization methods. These expression data provide a basis for the rational selection of gene candidates, and suggest possible metabolic bottlenecks within BIA metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis was performed for each of 15 different enzyme/protein groupings, highlighting many novel genes with potential involvement in the formation of one or more alkaloid types, including morphinan, aporphine, and phthalideisoquinoline alkaloids. Transcriptome resources were used to design and execute a case study of candidate N-methyltransferases (NMTs) from Glaucium flavum, which revealed predicted and novel enzyme activities. Conclusions: This study establishes an essential resource for the isolation and discovery of 1) functional homologues and 2) entirely novel catalysts within BIA metabolism. Functional analysis of G. flavum NMTs demonstrated the utility of this resource and underscored the importance of empirical determination of proposed enzymatic function. Publically accessible, fully annotated, BLAST-accessible transcriptomes were not previously available for most species included in this report, despite the rich repertoire of bioactive alkaloids found in these plants and their importance to traditional medicine. The results presented herein provide essential sequence information and inform experimental design for the continued elucidation of BIA metabolism."

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Estimating the fundamental frequency of speech remains an active area of research, with varied applications in speech recognition, speaker identification, and speech compression. A vast number of algorithms for estimatimating this quantity have been proposed over the years, and a number of speech and noise corpora have been developed for evaluating their performance. The present dataset contains estimated fundamental frequency tracks of 25 algorithms, six speech corpora, two noise corpora, at nine signal-to-noise ratios between -20 and 20 dB SNR, as well as an additional evaluation of synthetic harmonic tone complexes in white noise.</p>

<p>The dataset also contains pre-calculated performance measures both novel and traditional, in reference to each speech corpus&rsquo; ground truth, the algorithms&rsquo; own clean-speech estimate, and our own consensus truth. It can thus serve as the basis for a comparison study, or to replicate existing studies from a larger dataset, or as a reference for developing new fundamental frequency estimation algorithms. All source code and data is available to download, and entirely reproducible, albeit requiring about one year of processor-time.</p>

ABSTRACT<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Motivated by environmental applications such as synthetic fuel synthesis, plasma-driven conversion shows promise for efficient and scalable gas-conversion of CO2 to CO. Both discharge contraction and turbulent transport have a significant impact on the plasma processing conditions, but are, nevertheless, poorly understood. This work combines experiments and modeling to investigate how these aspects influence the CO production and destruction mechanisms in the vortex-stabilized CO2 microwave plasma reactor. For this, a two-dimensional axisymmetric tubular chemical kinetics model of the reactor is developed, with careful consideration of the non-uniform nature of the plasma and the vortex-induced radial turbulent transport. Energy efficiency and conversion of the dissociation process show a good agreement with the numerical results over a broad pressure range from 80 - 600mbar. The occurrence of an energy efficiency peak between 100 - 200 mbar is associated with a discharge mode transition. The net CO production rate is inhibited at low pressure by the plasma temperature, while recombination of CO back to CO2 dominates at high pressure. Turbulence-induced cooling and dilution of plasma products limit the extent of the latter. The maxima in energy efficiency observed experimentally around 40% are related to limits imposed by production and recombination processes. Based on these insights, feasible approaches for optimization of the plasma dissociation process are discussed.<br>

10.5281/zenodo.1906658,open,"Coordinates for pairs of neighbouring MODIS pixels containing dense and sparse land cover in New South Wales, Australia","<p>This data set relates to detecting changes in areas of native forest in New South Wales, Australia. Under the Australian government Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) initiative, land owners are able to generate Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) in exchange for preventing deforestation of native forest for which a clearing permit has previously been issued. To be eligible the native forest must have at least 20\% canopy coverage with tree height greater than two meters. At the commencement of a project an extensive audit is undertaken by an accredited third party and estimates made of the appropriate number of credits to be allocated throughout the project. A number of subsequent audits are also required to ensure compliance throughout the project lifetime. Projects have a permanence period of either 25 or 100 years. During this time period no clearing, with the exception of minimal thinning (&lt; 5 %), is permitted.</p>

<p>At the time of writing there are approximately 400 vegetation projects underway in Australia. A system of automated change alarms based on remotely sensed time series has the potential to significantly reduce the auditing workload and target it to locations where the forest cover has changed and the&nbsp; project may require reassessment. Continuous monitoring is also important to guarantee the integrity of the carbon credit units in circulation.The region considered occupies the western plains of the state of New South Wales. This is an arid region with the majority of land cover characterized by small shrubs. The forested regions protected under the ERF are majority free standing Eucalyptus trees. The western plains also experiences very low cloud cover making it another ideal location for passive remove sensing.</p>

<p>This data set was created with the intention that it will also be the subject of future studies. Due to the comparative scarcity of actual land cover change in this region the data set was created for the purpose of synthesizing realistic change time series. D=997 MODIS pixels were identified within regions currently assigned to a project which is currently earning carbon credits in exchange for avoided deforestation. These time series span the years of 2008 to 2018. For each pixel a corresponding pair was identified using high resolution imagery provided by Google Earth, DigitalGlobe. The pair was selected such that it is closely located and contains a similar type of land cover but at a lower density. Using this approach it is possible to generate a synthetic change time series by blending between the two while reducing any possible changes in geology, flora, aspect or climate that might occur over a large distance. Blending between high and low density aims to simulate gradual deforestation over the area of the pixel.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.w3r2280mj,open,Data from: Size-dependent sensitivity of stream amphipods indicates population-level responses to chemical pollution,"<p>Global change assessments have typically ignored synthetic chemical pollution, despite the rapid increase of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals in the environment. The paucity of research on the ecological effects of these 'micropollutants' undermines our efforts to address the freshwater biodiversity crisis. Understanding the responses of individual organisms to chemical pollution can help address this knowledge gap because individual-level effects can cascade across populations, communities, and ecosystems with devastating consequences.</p>

<p>Inputs of treated municipal wastewater are a major source of micropollutants in receiving environments. Here we assessed population and individual-level influences of treated wastewater on freshwater gammarid amphipods (<i>Gammarus</i> spp.) in Swiss lowland streams <i>in situ</i> and tested effects of a micropollutant mixture on individual <i>G. fossarum</i> using a common garden laboratory experiment. We hypothesised that population-level effects of wastewater are mediated through asymmetric sensitivities of juvenile and adult gammarids to chemical pollutants. We expected that life-stage specific sensitivities would reflect allometric theory relating body size to a wide range of organismal characteristics, including metabolism, growth, and mortality.</p>

<p>At the population level (i.e., field survey), we observed greatly reduced abundances of juvenile gammarids downstream of the wastewater discharge in three of the six sites surveyed, indicating the potential for demographic effects of pollution. At the individual level in a field transplant experiment, we found that the presence of wastewater led to a steeper positive relationship between gammarid body size and leaf consumption. In the laboratory experiment, we found that micropollutants had negative effects on consumption and growth rates, but a positive effect on survival. Differences in the relationship between gammarid body size and performance were subtle across treatments, although flatter slopes in growth appear to be a consistent response to chemical pollution. Faster growth rates appeared to be connected with reduced survival, placing individuals in control treatments and/or with smaller body size at greatest risk of mortality. Notably, juvenile gammarids had faster growth rates and lower survival than adults when exposed to micropollutants.</p>

<p>Our results demonstrate the potential for negative impacts of micropollutants in freshwater ecosystems. However, the results also show that organismal responses to chemical pollutants can be complex, whereby impacts at the individual level may act counter-intuitively to population-level dynamics. This highlights the need for more realistic experiments to better assess how organismal responses depend on life stage and body size, and how individual-level effects propagate to higher levels of biological organisation. Our study shows how allometric theory can be used to examine the effects of stressors on underlying organismal biology, population demographics, and link with broader macroecological patterns.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.4291s,open,Data from: A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function,"INTRODUCTION: Genetic interactions occur when mutations in two or more genes combine to generate an unexpected phenotype. An extreme negative or synthetic lethal genetic interaction occurs when two mutations, neither lethal individually, combine to cause cell death. Conversely, positive genetic interactions occur when two mutations produce a phenotype that is less severe than expected. Genetic interactions identify functional relationships between genes and can be harnessed for biological discovery and therapeutic target identification. They may also explain a considerable component of the undiscovered genetics associated with human diseases. Here, we describe construction and analysis of a comprehensive genetic interaction network for a eukaryotic cell.
RATIONALE: Genome sequencing projects are providing an unprecedented view of genetic variation. However, our ability to interpret genetic information to predict inherited phenotypes remains limited, in large part due to the extensive buffering of genomes, making most individual eukaryotic genes dispensable for life. To explore the extent to which genetic interactions reveal cellular function and contribute to complex phenotypes, and to discover the general principles of genetic networks, we used automated yeast genetics to construct a global genetic interaction network.
RESULTS: We tested most of the ~6000 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for all possible pairwise genetic interactions, identifying nearly 1 million interactions, including ~550,000 negative and ~350,000 positive interactions, spanning ~90% of all yeast genes. Essential genes were network hubs, displaying five times as many interactions as nonessential genes. The set of genetic interactions or the genetic interaction profile for a gene provides a quantitative measure of function, and a global network based on genetic interaction profile similarity revealed a hierarchy of modules reflecting the functional architecture of a cell. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections associated with defects in cell cycle progression or cellular proteostasis. Importantly, the global network illustrates how coherent sets of negative or positive genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathways to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.
CONCLUSION: A global genetic interaction network highlights the functional organization of a cell and provides a resource for predicting gene and pathway function. This network emphasizes the prevalence of genetic interactions and their potential to compound phenotypes associated with single mutations. Negative genetic interactions tend to connect functionally related genes and thus may be predicted using alternative functional information. Although less functionally informative, positive interactions may provide insights into general mechanisms of genetic suppression or resiliency. We anticipate that the ordered topology of the global genetic network, in which genetic interactions connect coherently within and between protein complexes and pathways, may be exploited to decipher genotype-to-phenotype relationships."

10.5061/dryad.p32p0,open,Data from: Exploring photosymbiotic ecology of planktic foraminifers from chamber-by-chamber isotopic history of individual foraminifers,"Evolution of photosymbiotic ecology is an important adaptation for planktic foraminifers that enhances the ecological advantage of living in oligotrophic oceans. Therefore, detecting photosymbiotic ecology in fossil species is one of the keys to understanding the paleobiodiversity dynamics of planktic foraminifers. Because foraminiferal tests record the ontogenetic history of ecological information in geochemical signatures, analyzing individual geochemical profiles with growth can reveal a species' ecology. This study examined chamber-by-chamber stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) of foraminiferal individuals to identify photosymbiotic signals. We observed an ontogenetic δ13C increase of up to 2.4‰, accompanied by relatively stable, negative δ18O, in the symbiotic species Globigerinoides conglobatus and Globigerinoides sacculifer. In contrast, δ13C and δ18O showed significant positive correlation during ontogeny in the asymbiotic species Globorotalia truncatulinoides. These two ecological groups produce contrasting isotopic profiles, thereby allowing us to use our ontogenetic isotopic analyses of individual specimens to identify algal photosymbiosis in fossil foraminifers. The chamber-by-chamber isotope analyses with individual ontogeny have great advantages in analyzing rare species because only one individual is required to describe ontogenetic isotopic history. In addition to photosymbiotic identification, our methods hold great potential to provide new insight into species paleoecological studies such as the ontogenetic history of calcification depth."
10.5061/dryad.1rn8pk0qm,open,Data from: Population genomic diversity and structure at the discontinuous southern range of the Great Gray Owl in North America,"<p>Species' distributions are often discontinuous near the edge of the range where the environment may be more variable than the core of the range. Range discontinuity can reduce or cut off gene flow to small peripheral populations and lead to genetic drift and subsequent loss of genetic diversity. The southern extent of the Great Gray Owl ( Strixnebulosa) range in North America is discontinuous, unlike their northern core range across the boreal forests. We sampled owls from five different locations on the periphery of the range across the western US (Wyoming, Idaho, California, northern Oregon, and southern Oregon) to investigate genetic population structure and genetic diversity. Using a reduced-representation genomic sequencing approach to genotype 123 individuals at 4,817 single nucleotide polymorphic loci, we identified four genetically differentiated populations: California, southern Oregon, northern Oregon, and Wyoming and Idaho grouped together as a single Rocky Mountain population. The four genetically differentiated populations of Great Gray Owls identified in this study display high differentiation and low genetic variation, which is suggestive of long-term isolation and lack of connectivity, potentially caused by range discontinuity. The populations that lack habitat connectivity to the rest of the breeding range (i.e. those in California and Oregon) had lower genetic diversity than the Rocky Mountain population that is connected to the core of the range. These factors and other risks (such as disease and human-caused mortality) heighten susceptibility of these range-edge populations to future habitat and climate changes, genetic diversity erosion, and potential extinction vortex. For these reasons, protecting and monitoring this species on the southern edge of their range is vital.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.m0cfxpp0m,open,Plant volatiles induced by herbivore eggs prime defenses and mediate shifts in the reproductive strategy of receiving plants,"<p>Plants can detect cues associated with the risk of future herbivory and modify defense phenotypes accordingly; however, our current understanding is limited both with respect to the range of early warning cues to which plants respond and the nature of the responses. Here we report that exposure to volatile emissions from plant tissues infested with herbivore eggs promotes stronger defense responses to subsequent herbivory in two Brassica species. Furthermore, exposure to these volatile cues elicited an apparent shift from growth to reproduction in Brassica nigra, with exposed plants exhibiting increased flower and seed production, but reduced leaf production, relative to unexposed controls. Our results thus document plant defense priming in response to a novel environmental cue, oviposition-induced plant volatiles, while also showing that plant responses to early warning cues can include changes in both defense and life-history traits.</p>"
10.7280/D11H3X,open,Annual Ice Velocity of the Greenland Ice Sheet (2010-2017),"<p>We derive surface ice velocity using data from 16 satellite sensors deployed by 6 different space agencies. The list of sensors is given in the Table S1. The SAR data are processed from raw to single look complex using the GAMMA processor (www.gamma-rs.ch). All measurements rely on consecutive images where the ice displacement is estimated from tracking or interferometry (Joughin et al. 1998, Michel and Rignot 1999, Mouginot et al. 2012). Surface ice motion is detected using a speckle tracking algorithm for SAR instruments and feature tracking for Landsat. The cross-correlation program for both SAR and optical images is ampcor from the JPL/Caltech repeat orbit interferometry package (ROI_PAC). We assemble a composite ice velocity mosaic at 150 m posting using our entire speed database as described in Mouginot et al. 2017 (Fig. 1A). The ice velocity maps are also mosaicked in annual maps at 150 m posting, covering July, 1st to June, 30th of the following year, i.e. centered on January, 1st (12) because a majority of historic data were acquired in winter season, hence spanning two calendar years.<br>
We use Landsat-1&amp;2/MSS images between 1972 and 1976 and combine image pairs up to 2 years apart to measure the displacement of surface features between images as described in Dehecq et al., 2015 or Mouginot et al. 2017. We use the 1978 2-m orthorectified aerial images to correct the geolocation of Landsat-1 and -2 images (Korsgaard et al., 2016). Between 1984 and 1991, we process Landsat-4&amp;5/TM image pairs acquired up to 1-year apart. Only few Landsat-4 and -5 images (~3%) needed geocoding refinement using the same 1978 reference as used previously. Between 1991 and 1998, we process radar images from the European ERS-1/2, with a repeat cycle varying from 3 to 36 days depending on the mission phase. Between 1999 and 2013, we used Landsat-7, ASTER, RADARSAT-1/2, ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR to determine surface velocity (Joughin et al., 2010; Howat, I. 2017; Rignot and Mouginot, 2012). After 2013, we use Landsat-8, Sentinel-1a/b and RADARSAT-2 (Mouginot et al., 2017). All synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets are processed assuming surface parallel flow using the digital elevation model (DEM) from the Greenland Mapping Project (GIMP; Howat et al., 2014) and calibrated as described in Mouginot et al., 2012, 2017. Data were provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), the EU Copernicus program (through ESA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.

10.5281/zenodo.2630385,open,Task graphs for benchmarking schedulers,"<p><strong>Workflow Task Graph Dataset</strong></p>

<p>This dataset contains three sets of task graphs representing different types of task workflows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Elementary</em> - contains trivial graph shapes, such as tasks with no dependencies or simple fork-join graphs. This set should test how the scheduler heuristics react to basic graph scenarios that frequently form parts of larger workflows.</li>
	<li><em>IRW</em> - is inspired by real-world workflows, such as machine learning cross-validation or map-reduce.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;<em>Pegasus</em> - is derived from graphs created by Pegasus Synthetic Workflow Generators (https://github.com/pegasus-isi/WorkflowGenerator)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the provided task graphs are generated and compatible with ESTEE (https://github.com/It4innovations/estee) that allows to simulate their execution on a distributed system using various scheduling heuristics and environment conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Data Format</strong></p>

<p>Task graphs are stored in {elementary, irw, pegasus}.zip files that contain JSON representation of respective task graphs with the following fields:</p>

<ul>
	<li>`graph_name` - Task graph name</li>
	<li>`graph_id` - Unique task graph identifier</li>
	<li>&nbsp;`graph` - Task graph representation - list of tasks where each task is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:</li>
	<li>&nbsp;`d`: Actual task duration in seconds (float value)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;`e_d`: User estimated task duration in seconds (float value)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;`cpus`: Task CPU core requirements (integer value)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;`outputs`: List of task outputs (list of integers indicating sizes of task outputs in MiB)</li>
	<li>&nbsp;`inputs`: List of task inputs in format of list [task\_id, output\_index]}. Output index is zero-based.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example this task graph:</p>

<p>[{&#39;d&#39;: 200, &#39;e_d&#39;: 180, &#39;cpus&#39;: 1, &#39;outputs&#39;: [100], &#39;inputs&#39;: []},</p>

<p>{&#39;d&#39;: 50, &#39;e_d&#39;: 60, &#39;cpus&#39;: 2, &#39;outputs&#39;: [], &#39;inputs&#39;: [[0, 0]]}]</p>

<p>contains two tasks. One requiring no input, single CPU core with estimated duration 180s, actual duration 200s and producing a single output of 100 MiB. And another one requiring as an input task0&#39;s 0-th output, requiring 2 CPU cores, producing no output with estimated duration 60s and actual duration 50s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parsing the data</strong></p>

<p>In Python, to load the elementary task graph set run the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code class=""language-python"">import pandas as pd

graphs = pd.read_json(""./elementary.zip"")</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have Estee installed, you can use its provided `json_deserialize`</p>

<p>function to parse the JSON encoded graphs into Estee TaskGraph data structure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code class=""language-python"">from estee.serialization.dask_json import json_deserialize

graph_json = graphs.loc[0, ""graph""]

graph = json_deserialize(graph)</code></pre>

<p><strong>1. Periodical Sudden Drifts</strong></p>

<p>For this case study, we have generated two synthetic logs (<span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_1\)</span>&nbsp;and <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_2\)</span>) by modeling two variants of the insurance claim process described in [1] in CPN Tools&nbsp;and by simulating the models.&nbsp;<span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_1\)</span> contains 14,840 events and <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_2\)</span> contains 16,438 events.</p>

<p>We merged the logs (eight alternations of <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_1\)</span> and <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_2\)</span>) using the <em>Stream Package</em>&nbsp;in ProM&nbsp;(the source code of the package is publicly available at https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/Packages/Stream/Trunk).&nbsp;The same package has been used to transform the resulting log into an event stream. The event stream contains 250,224 events and has several sudden concept drifts (one for every switch from <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_1\)</span> to <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_2\)</span>).</p>

<p><strong>2. Gradual Drifts</strong></p>

<p>We have considered two variants of the insurance claim process described in [1],&nbsp;<span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_1'\)</span>&nbsp;(with 21 activities) and <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_2'\)</span>&nbsp;(with 19 activities). We have also designed 6 additional models&nbsp;<span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_a,\dots, \mathcal{M}_f\)</span>&nbsp;to represent the intermediate steps to go from <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_1'\)</span>&nbsp;to <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_2'\)</span>.&nbsp;Therefore, <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_1'\)</span> and <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_a\)</span>&nbsp;are very similar and the same happens for <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_a\)</span> compared to <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_b\)</span>, for <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_b\)</span> compared to <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{M}_c\)</span>, and so on.&nbsp;We have simulated these models generating 8 logs (<span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_1', \mathcal{L}_a, \dots,\mathcal{L}_f, \mathcal{L}_2'\)</span>). <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_1'\)</span>&nbsp;contains 139,938 events, <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_2'\)</span>&nbsp;contains 128,696 events and <span class=""math-tex"">\(\mathcal{L}_a,\dots,\mathcal{L}_f\)</span>&nbsp;contain 77,231 events (altogether).</p>

<p>Using the <em>Stream Package</em>, we have generated an event stream containing 345,865 events.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.3943700,open,Developing a deep Learning network to retrieve ocean hydrographic profiles in the North Atlantic from combined satellite and in situ measurements: test datasets.,"<p>We provide here the datasets used for the test and assessment of a deep learning algorithm which is presently candidate for the development of a daily 3D ocean product covering the North Atlantic at 1/10&deg; resolution, over the 2010-2018 period, as part of the European Space Agency World Ocean Circulation project (ESA-WOC). The method is based on a stacked Long Short-Term Memory neural network, coupled to a Monte-Carlo dropout approach, and allows to project satellite-derived sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity and absolute dynamic topography data at depth after training with sparse co-located in situ vertical hydrographic profiles (Buongiorno Nardelli, 2020, doi:<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.3390%2Frs12193151?_sg%5B0%5D=0xE-347r7Hvb80klJcEo811AhUiXq-twG_E6l4yB-BfIKkVtW-lVLGcO02mTFkUczvozYYI0WCPyUBFR3kzWNGGZKg.ftvLheFrzHIJriO4qW2bdxalvR_TWt3MpwUfvto3EemhRgvDRGwJ9Mdy4Xr0IcGCfICivf4j-VqTgKxVvXRogA"">10.3390/rs12193151</a>).&nbsp;</p>

10.5281/zenodo.4390084,open,High-resolution inundation dataset for coastal India and Bangladesh,"<p>This collection of gridded data layers provides the extent of inundation in May 2020 resulting from the cyclone Amphan in 39 coastal districts in India and Bangladesh.</p>

<p><strong>Input data:</strong></p>

<p>These geospatial data layers are derived from Sentinel-1 dual-polarization C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for pre-Amphan (May 5-18, 2020) and post-Amphan (May 22-30, 2020) periods. We accessed ready-to-use SAR data on Google Earth Engine (GEE). These input data were preprocessed using Ground Range Detected (GRD) border-noise removal, thermal noise removal, radiometric calibration, and terrain correction, to derive backscatter coefficients (&sigma;&deg;) in decibels (dB). We used VH polarisation instead of VV, since the latter is known to be affected by windy conditions as compared to VH.</p>

<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>

<p>We developed a binary water/non-water classification scheme for the pre- and post-Amphan images using the automated Otsu thresholding approach that finds optimum threshold values based on clusters found in the histograms of pixel values. This analysis resulted in eight images: four each for pre-Amphan and post-Amphan periods (one each for coastal districts of Odisha and West Bengal and two for Bangladesh for each period). The pixels in these images have two values: 0 for non-water and 1 for water.</p>

<p>We then used a decision rule to identify areas that changed from &lsquo;non-water&rsquo; to &lsquo;water&rsquo; after the cyclone. The decision rule generated the &lsquo;inundation layer&rsquo; with the permanent water bodies such as river, lakes, oceans and aquaculture masked out. This analysis resulted in four images, each with pixels with a value of 1 for inundated regions.</p>

<p><strong>Data set format:</strong></p>

<p>The spatial resolution of all the derived datasets is 10m. These georeferenced datasets are distributed in GEOTIFF format, and are compatible with GIS and/or image processing software, such as R and ArcGIS. The GIS-ready raster files can be used directly in mapping and geospatial analysis.</p>

Manipulating materials in transparent containers is essential in many fields and depends heavily on vision. This work supplies a new procedurally generated dataset consisting of 50k images of liquids and solid objects inside transparent containers. The image annotations include 3D models and material properties (color/transparency/roughness...) for the vessel and its content. The synthetic (CGI) part of the dataset was procedurally generated using 13k different objects, 500 different environments (HDRI), and 1450 material textures (PBR) combined with simulated liquids and procedurally generated vessels.

<p>The two folders contain relatively similar data styles.<br>
The data in No_Shift contain images that were generated with no camera shift in the camera paramters. If you try to predict 3d model from an image as a depth map, this is easier to use (Otherwise, you need to adapt the image using the shift). For all other purposes, both folders are the same, and you can use either or both. In addition, a&nbsp; real image dataset for testing is given in the RealSense file.</p>

10.5061/dryad.83bk3j9nr,open,Data from: Volatile fatty acid and aldehyde abundances evolve with behavior and habitat temperature in Sceloporus lizards,"<p>Animal signals evolve by striking a balance between the need to convey information through particular habitats and the limitations of what types of signals can most easily be produced and perceived. Here, we present new results from field measures of undisturbed behavior and biochemical analyses of scent marks from 12 species of <i>Sceloporus</i> lizards to explore whether evolutionary changes in chemical composition are better predicted by measures of species behavior , particularly those associated with visual displays, chemoreception, and locomotion, or by measures of habitat climate (precipitation and temperature). We found that more active lizard species used fewer compounds in their volatile scent marks, perhaps conveying less specific information about individual, sex and species identity. Scent marks from more active lizard species also had higher proportions of saturated fatty acids, and the evolution of these compounds has been tracking the phylogeny closely as we would expect for a metabolic by-product. In contrast, the proportions of unsaturated fatty acids were better explained by evolutionary shifts in habitat temperature (not precipitation), with species in warmer climates using almost no volatile unsaturated fatty acids. The proportion of aldehydes was explained by both behavior and environment, decreasing with behavioral activity and increasing with habitat temperature. Our results highlight the evolutionary flexibility of complex chemical signals, with different chemical compounds responding to different elements of the selective landscape over evolutionary time.</p>"

In order to predict anthropogenic impacts on these timings, more insight is needed into the interplay between environment and molecular timing mechanisms. This is particularly true in marine environments.</p>

<p class=""BodyText1"">Using high-resolution, long-term daylight measurements from a habitat of the marine annelid <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i>, we find that temporal changes in UVA/deep violet intensities, more than longer wavelengths, can provide annual time information, which differs from annual changes in photoperiod. We developed experimental setups that resemble natural daylight illumination conditions, and automated, quantifiable behavioral tracking. Experimental reduction of UVA/deep violet light (app. 370-430nm) under long photoperiod (LD16:8) significantly decreases locomotor activities, comparable to the decrease caused by short photoperiod (8:16). In contrast, altering UVA/deep violet light intensities does not cause differences in locomotor levels under short photoperiod. This modulation of locomotion by UVA/deep violet light under long photoperiod requires c-opsin1, an UVA/deep violet-sensor employing G<sub>i</sub>-signalling. C-opsin1 also regulates the levels of rate-limiting enzymes for monogenic amine synthesis and of several neurohormones, including PDF, Vasotocin (Vasopressin/Oxytocin) and NPY-1.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.5614101,open,Probabilistic-deterministic storm surge return level dataset for the Bengal delta,"<p>Bengal delta shoreline, spanning Bangladesh and India, gets hit every 3 years on average by a major tropical cyclone. Although their occurrence is relatively moderate compared to other tropical regions (accounting for only 5% of global cyclones), the impact of these events is major, accounting for 50% of the victims recorded worldwide. This is due to the very low topography of the delta above sea level (less than 5 meters), high storm surge induced water level and flooding, combined with the high density of the vulnerable population.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On one hand, the unavailability of long-term reliable water level data on a sparse tide-gauge network along the coastline has hindered the assessment of storm surge hazards. The application of hydrodynamic modelling to fill the data gap also suffers from the unavailability of a reliable long-term storm dataset over the region. The complex topography of the Bengal delta, with defence structures, and a dense network of rivers presents another modelling challenge. Finally, the interaction of tide, surge and wave further complicate the numerical complexity, needing a coupled modelling framework.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to advancements made to acquire high-quality regional nearshore bathymetry and topography (Krien et al. 2016, Khan et al. 2019), as well as coupled storm surge modelling (Krien et al. 2017, Khan et al. 2021), the tidal and storm surge dynamics over the Bengal delta is now well captured by recent high-resolution coupled SCHISM-WWM Bay of Bengal model (Khan et al. 2021). To estimate the risk of storm surge and associated flooding across the Bengal delta, we have integrated the wave-coupled hydrodynamic model of Khan et al. (2021) for a large ensemble (~3600 cyclones, ~5000 years of storm activity) of synthetic cyclones generated through the statistical-deterministic method of Emanuel (2006). Our storm and surge ensemble covers the whole range of natural variability of storm frequency, size, intensity and track location, with a dense spatial distribution. The interactions among the tide, surge, and waves are modelled explicitly at high spatial resolution. The storm surge-induced water level at various return periods, up to 500 years, is then determined at high spatial resolution (250m at the coast) using a ranking-based technique.</p>

<p>The dataset distributed here represents the storm surge water level estimate (e.g. total water level from the tide, surge, and wave computed dynamically through the model) at 25 to 500 year return period (25-year step). The corresponding variable in the self-describing netCDF data file is &#39;maxelev&#39;. The estimated storm surge water level values are interpolated in a 30&quot; (~1km at the equator) structured grid over the Bengal delta from the original unstructured-grid model outputs (250m resolution at the coast).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simplified hydraulic geometry relationships representing the average conditions over longer reaches could reduce the need for detailed field surveys and minimize the computational burden while studying river channel flow dynamics.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Natural streams are characterized by changes in cross-section geometry and geophysical properties (e.g., bed-roughness, channel slope, channel planform, sediment load,&nbsp;etc.) along their reaches. Variations in the shape&nbsp;of the channel bed geometry are&nbsp;affected&nbsp;by&nbsp;several interacting features&nbsp;including the effect of different flow regimes, channel slope, sediment load, etc. Simplifying the river bed geometries will reduce the burden of assembling the required data and&nbsp;computational burden. &ldquo;At-A-Station&rdquo; Hydraulic Geometry (or AHG) relations are power-law functions that relate key hydraulic variables&nbsp;(i.e., velocity, depth, width, and flow area) to&nbsp;discharge at&nbsp;a river monitoring station (Dingman 2007; Dingman and Afshari 2018).</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The AHG relations have been introduced and discussed among researchers, engineers, and geomorphologists since the &#39;50s based upon a limited number of observations made over a few flow monitoring stations across the United States. Afshari et. al., 2017 introduced a data filtering procedure that was trained and tested over both synthetic and realistic data followed by being applied over ~4000 U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s river monitoring stations to compute AHG parameters based upon robust hydraulic vs. discharge measures. Estimated AHG parameters are combined with&nbsp;basic statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) of key morphological and geophysical features at all USGS river monitoring sites, e.g. stream (Stahler) order, channel pattern (channel sinuosity), channel bed-slope, and channel&nbsp;lateral [or overbank] slope. The fundamental hydraulics, geographical, and geophysical data sources (websites) applied for making the &quot;USGS Table AHG Parameters And Supplementary Data&quot; table are</p>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In doing so, potential interrelation among independent and dependent variables will be highlighted. Accordingly, given some assumptions, it is verified&nbsp;how well channel morphology and hydraulic components are intertwined and combined with AHG parameters and how categorizing river monitoring stations according to these characteristics will be practical and useful for further studies.</p>

<p>Simplified hydraulic geometry relationships representing the average conditions over longer reaches could reduce the need for detailed field surveys and minimize the computational burden while studying or carrying out numerical analyses and of the flow dynamics.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Natural streams are characterized by changes in cross-section geometry, slope, and geophysical properties (bed-roughness, channel slope, etc.) along with their reaches. Variations in the shape and size of the channel bed geometry result from several interacting features of the river system including the effect of different flow regimes, slope, sediment load, etc. Simplifying the river bed geometries could reduce the burden of assembling the required data, so implementing less detailed routing procedures could lower the computational burden. &ldquo;At-A-Station&rdquo; Hydraulic Geometry (or AHG) relations are power-law functions which relate river&nbsp;key the hydraulics (i.e., velocity, depth, width, and flow area) to&nbsp;discharge at&nbsp;a river monitoring station (Dingman 2007; Dingman and Afshari 2018).</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The AHG relations have been introduced and discussed among researchers, engineers, and geomorphologist since the &#39;50s based upon a limited number of observations made over a few flow monitoring stations across the United States. Afshari et. al., 2017 introduced a data filtering procedure which was trained and tested over both synthetic and realistic data followed by being applied over ~4000 U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s river monitoring stations to compute AHG parameters based upon robust hydraulic vs. discharge measures. Given &ldquo;refined&rdquo; dataset, estimated AHG parameters are combined with&nbsp;basic statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation) of key morphological and geophysical features at all USGS river monitoring sites, e.g. stream (Stahler) order, channel pattern (channel sinuosity), channel bed-slope, and channel&nbsp;lateral [or overbank] slope. The fundamental hydraulics, geographical, and geophysical data sources (websites) applied for making the &quot;USGS Table AHG Parameters And Supplementary Data&quot; table are</p>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Doing so, potential interrelation among independent and dependent variables will be highlighted. Accordingly, given some assumptions, it is verified&nbsp;how well channel morphology and hydraulic components are intertwined and combined with AHG parameters and how categorizing river monitoring stations according to these characteristics will be practical and useful for further studies.</p>

<p>In addition to a comprehensive evaluation of the methane adsorption on pure-carbon maquette surface, we extended the adsorption studies to B- and N-doped adsorbents. We found consistent preference for N-doped materials for methane storage. In addition to discussing energy differences and structural variations as a function of the nature of dopant, we uncovered details of the electronic structure of methane interactions and its variability along the series of C, B, and N. The predicted heat of adsorption values are now informing on-going experimental synthetic work in the Stadie laboratory toward the optimization of gas storage materials.</p>

<p>The results reported in the manuscripts stimulate extension of our work to larger maquettes of porous carbon surfaces with synthetically relevant functional groups, alternative ring sizes, curvature, and other heteroatom substitutional dopants. An additional notable merit is our effort to provide a clear thermodynamic connection among microscopic and macroscopic observables related to physical properties of gas storage materials and interfaces.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.4570303,open,Mullus surmuletus environmental DNA intraspecific metabarcoding Next-Generation Sequencing data,"<p>Four 250-liter aquariums were bleached clean one day prior to be used (filled with seawater; fish transfer) in Montpellier (France). Seawater collected by the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea at Palavas-les-Flots (France) was first stored in a 1,000 L tank for two weeks, under UV treatment to avoid any contamination. The aquariums were then filled with 120 L of this water. Each aquarium had a closed-circuit water circulation and was equipped with an air bubbles exhauster in a tube that brought up the water on a neutral synthetic foam filter. The aquariums were thus oxygenated and the coarsest suspended matter was filtered out. The remaining seawater in the tank was used as a negative control (Aquarium 1). Nine to eleven fish were added to each of the four aquariums (Fig. 1). The aquarium water was sampled six hours after introducing the fish into the aquariums using an Athena peristaltic pump (SPYGEN, Le Bourget-du-Lac, France) with a nominal flow of 1.0 L/min to filter 30 L, and VigiDNA 0.22 &mu;m crossflow filtration capsules (SPYGEN) with disposable sterile tubing. After filtration, 80 mL of CL1 conservation buffer (SPYGEN) was added before storing the samples at ambient temperature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We reanalyzed here two eDNA samples of 30 L replicate each, collected in &nbsp;the Mediterranean Sea, at Banyuls (France, coordinates: 42.41568, 3.17110) and Calvi (France, coordinates: 42.62964, 8.89161) published in a previous metabarcoding analysis and known to contain <em>M. surmuletus</em> sequences (detected with the metabarcode teleo 12S) (Boulanger <em>et al.</em> 2021). These two Mediterranean eDNA samples were amplified and sequenced using the primers developed for this study and then analyzed using the best-performing pipeline as determined by our evaluation. These two samples were used as proof of concept of the possibility to estimate within site variability in real conditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DNA extraction and amplification from eDNA samples were performed by the company SPYGEN (Le Bourget du Lac, France) in separate, dedicated rooms following the protocol described by Polanco Fern&aacute;ndez <em>et al.</em> (2020). The amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 &mu;L including 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 10 mM of Tris-HCl, 50 mM of KCl, 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 &mu;M of each primer, 0.2 &mu;g/&mu;L of bovine serum albumin (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and 3 &mu;L of DNA template. The PCR mixture was denatured at 95&deg;C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 30 s at 95&deg;C, 30 s at 47&deg;C and 1 min at 72&deg;C and a final elongation step at 72&deg;C for 7 min.&nbsp; The primers were 5&rsquo;-labelled with an eight-nucleotide tag unique to each DNA sample, allowing each sequence to be assigned to the corresponding sample during the sequence analysis. Twelve replicate PCRs were run per sample. Two libraries were prepared using the MetaFast protocol (Fasteris 2020, <a href=""https://www.fasteris.com/dna/"">https://www.fasteris.com/dna/</a>) and the sequencing was performed by Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland) on two separate runs on an Illumina MiSeq (2x250 bp) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the Miseq Kit v3 (Illumina) following the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. Two negative extraction controls and one negative PCR control (12 replicates of ultrapure water) were amplified and sequenced to monitor for possible contaminants (Polanco Fern&aacute;ndez <em>et al.</em>, 2020).</p>

10.5281/zenodo.6323251,open,Diverse Topologies for Evaluation of Geometric Similarity Metrics,"<p>A collection of 7 datasets with each set containing 3D shapes with varying topological complexity. The datasets can be used to compare different metrics of geometric dissimilarity. Two of the datasets have topologically complex shapes that resemble designs obtained from topology optimization, a widely used design optimization method for engineering structures.</p>

<p>We used this dataset for a related journal article with the following abstract: &quot;In the early stages of engineering design, multitudes of feasible designs can be generated using structural optimization methods by varying the design requirements or user preferences for different performance objectives. Data mining such potentially large datasets is a challenging task. An unsupervised data-centric approach for exploring designs is to find clusters of similar designs and recommend only the cluster representatives for review. Design similarity can be defined not only on a purely functional level but also based on geometric properties, such as size, shape, and topology. While metrics such as chamfer distance measure the geometrical differences intuitively, it is more useful for design exploration to use metrics based on <em>geometric features</em>, which are extracted from high-dimensional 3D geometric data using dimensionality reduction techniques. If the Euclidean distance in the <em>geometric features</em> is meaningful, the features can be combined with performance attributes resulting in an aggregate feature vector that can potentially be useful in design exploration based on both geometry and performance. We propose a novel approach to evaluate such derived metrics by measuring their similarity with the metrics commonly used in 3D object classification. Furthermore, we measure clustering accuracy, which is a state-of-the-art unsupervised approach to evaluate metrics. For this purpose, we use a labeled, synthetic dataset with topologically complex designs. From our results, we conclude that Pointcloud Autoencoder is promising in encoding geometric features and developing a comprehensive design exploration method.&quot;</p>

<p>For each dataset, shapes/designs are saved as surface mesh files (extension: stl) and point cloud files (extension: ply) in the folders &quot;stls&quot; and &quot;plys&quot; respectively. A brief description of the 7 different datasets is in the following table. For each dataset, the designs are named using numbers starting from 0, e.g., &ldquo;0.stl, 1.stl, &hellip;, 19.stl&rdquo; in the folder for the surface mesh files. Some of the datasets are labeled, i.e., each design belongs to a class. In a labeled dataset, all classes have the same number of designs, and the designs are named in the order of their class. For example, a labeled dataset with 4 designs and 2 classes contains files whose names start with {0, 1, 2, 3} where the designs {0, 1} belong to class 1, and {2, 3} belong to class 2.</p>

10.5061/dryad.9p8cz8wf7,open,Ligand-dependent effects of methionine-8 oxidation in parathyroid hormone peptide analogs,"<p>LA-PTH is a long-acting parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptide analog in pre-clinical development for hypoparathyroidism (HP). Like native PTH, LA-PTH contains a methionine at position 8 that is predicted to be critical for function. We assessed the impact of methionine oxidation on the functional properties of LA-PTH and control PTH ligands. Oxidation of PTH(1-34) resulted in marked (~20-fold) reductions in binding affinity on the PTH receptor-1 (PTHR1) in cell membranes, similarly diminished potency for cAMP signaling in osteoblastic cell lines (SaOS-2 and UMR106), and impaired efficacy for raising blood calcium in mice. Surprisingly, oxidation of LA-PTH resulted in little or no change in these functional responses. The signaling potency of oxidized-LA-PTH was, however, reduced ~40-fold compared to LA-PTH in cells expressing a PTHR1 construct that lacks the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD). Molecular modeling revealed that while Met8 of both LA-PTH and PTH(1-34) is situated within the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket of the receptor's transmembrane domain bundle (TMD), the Met8 sidechain position is shifted for the two ligands such that upon Met8 oxidation of PTH(1-34) steric clashes occur that are not seen with oxidized LA-PTH. The findings suggest that LA-PTH and PTH(1-34) engage the receptor differently in the Met8-interaction environment of the TMD bundle, and that this interaction environment can be allosterically influenced by the ECD component of the ligand-receptor complex. The findings should be useful for the future development of novel PTH-based peptide therapeutics for diseases of bone and mineral ion metabolism.</p>"

However, the LG6 analysis improves on the training data and land cover labeling system used in LG5. For LG6, we developed a modified version of the MassGIS 2005 Land Use/Land Cover polygons and legend in an effort to provide greater thematic detail as well as increase the ecological relevancy of the mapped results. Integrating the CCDC approach and our detailed land cover training dataset, we produced a 30-year time series of land cover maps for the Massachusetts Mainland and Islands as well as offshore waters. The original maps generated by the CCDC algorithms were then manually post-processed to improve spatial accuracy of change detection results, and final results including post-processing steps are available here.</p>

10.5061/dryad.39h5m,open,Data from: Natural variation in preparation for nutrient depletion reveals a cost-benefit tradeoff,"Maximizing growth and survival in the face of a complex, time-varying environment is a common problem for single-celled organisms in the wild. When offered two different sugars as carbon sources, microorganisms first consume the preferred sugar, then undergo a transient growth delay, the ""diauxic lag,"" while inducing genes to metabolize the less preferred sugar. This delay is commonly assumed to be an inevitable consequence of selection to maximize use of the preferred sugar. Contrary to this view, we found that many natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae display short or nonexistent diauxic lags when grown in mixtures of glucose (preferred) and galactose. These strains induce galactose utilization (GAL) genes hours before glucose exhaustion, thereby ""preparing"" for the transition from glucose to galactose metabolism. The extent of preparation varies across strains, and seems to be determined by the steady-state response of GAL genes to mixtures of glucose and galactose rather than by induction kinetics. Although early GAL gene induction gives strains a competitive advantage once glucose runs out, it comes at a cost while glucose is still present. Costs and benefits correlate with the degree of preparation: strains with higher expression of GAL genes prior to glucose exhaustion experience a larger upfront growth cost but also a shorter diauxic lag. Our results show that classical diauxic growth is only one extreme on a continuum of growth strategies constrained by a cost–benefit tradeoff. This type of continuum is likely to be common in nature, as similar tradeoffs can arise whenever cells evolve to use mixtures of nutrients."

Hybridization and introgression are not uncommon in closely related populations that experience secondary contact during a range expansion. Allen's Hummingbird (<i>Selasphorus sasin</i>) in California comprises two subspecies: the migratory <i>S. s. sasin,</i> which winters in central Mexico and breeds in central and northern California, and the resident <i>S. s. sedentarius</i>, which lives and breeds year-round on several of the Channel Islands off the California coast. Within recent decades, Allen's Hummingbirds have been found living and breeding year-round in the southern California peri-urban mainland near Los Angeles. Ornithologists assumed that the L.A. birds were an expansion of the island subspecies, <i>S. s. sedentarius</i> due to similar but very subtle morphological characteristics. <span>However, the genetic relationships among the three putative populations of Allen's hummingbird—migratory, southern California mainland, and island—are unknown. We investigated these relationships by analyzing variation of single nucleotide polymorphisms from the three geographic regions where S. sasin are present. Our population genomic analyses indicate that </span><i><span>S. sasin</span></i><span> hummingbirds inhabiting mainland southern California are a hybrid </span><span>population resulting from admixture between <i>S. s. sasin</i> and <i>S. s. sedentarius</i>. From one perspective, these results may be interpreted as a positive development for <i>S. s. sasin</i> as the growing population represent an overall increase in the <i>S. sasin</i> population, and the expanding population contains a significant representation of <i>S. s. sasin</i> alleles.</span></p>"

While LTP has been extensively studied using electrophysiology and light microscopy, several questions regarding the molecular mechanisms of AMPAR delivery via trafficking vesicles remain outstanding, including the gross molecular make up of AMPAR trafficking organelles and identification and location of calcium sensors required for SNARE complex-dependent membrane fusion of such trafficking vesicles with the plasma membrane. Here, we isolated AMPAR containing vesicles (ACVs) from whole mouse brains via immunoisolation and characterized them using immunoelectron microscopy, immunoblotting, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified several proteins on ACVs that were previously found to play a role in AMPAR trafficking, including synaptobrevin-2, Rabs, the SM protein Munc18-1, the calcium-sensor synaptotagmin-1, as well as several new candidates, including synaptophysin and synaptogyrin on ACV membranes. Here, we present three biological replicates of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of AMPA receptor containing vesicles.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.1g1jwstvm,open,How hydrological connectivity regulates the plant recovery process in salt marshes,"<p>1. Designing effective restoration strategies is a priority in recovering salt marsh plants. As a main driver underpinning the success of plant recovery process, hydrological connectivity can regulate life history process-based restoration strategies, but the relations are not clear.</p>

<p>2. Plant recovering needs to go through a whole life history process, from seed to adult. Common restoration strategies are seed addition (SA) or seedling transplantation (ST), which start from seed germination and seedling growth stage. Besides these two strategies, another strategy starting from seed retention stage, microtopographic adjustment (MA), were designed to study the relationship with hydrological connectivity. And a framework was construct to assess a gradient of hydrological connectivity between marsh plain and sea and conducted several field experiments to test their relationships.</p>

<p>3. The composite measurement of hydrological connectivity with five geomorphic variables can well represent the variation of environmental factors. Soil moisture, inundation frequency and sediment deposition were positive correlated, while soil salinity and hardness were negative correlated with hydrological connectivity.</p>

<p>4. The success of different restoration strategies varied with hydrological connectivity. MA showed a monotone decreasing trend, while SA and ST showed unimodal trend with the increasing of hydrological connectivity. The important is, each strategy occupies a non-overlapping optimum range along hydrological connectivity gradient, they are low hydrological connectivity for MA (0 – 0.28), middle hydrological connectivity for SA (0.28 – 0.55) and high hydrological connectivity for ST (0.55 – 1).</p>

<p>5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings expand the quantification of the hydrological environment beyond elevation or distance or other single index to include a range of elements of hydrological connectivity, and illustrate the underlying mechanisms of hydrological connectivity regulating restoration strategies based on different life stages. The results not only provide a reliable framework to assess hydrological connectivity, but also the guidance to select optimum restoration strategy under different hydrological connectivities, or to regulate the hydrological connectivity variables (topography on marsh plain and morphology of tidal creeks) to relief stresses. These findings will benefit ecological restoration and coastal management a lot.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.g1jwstqmw,open,Ant cuticular hydrocarbons are heritable and associated with variation in colony productivity,"<p>In social insects, cuticular hydrocarbons function in nestmate recognition and also provide a waxy barrier against desiccation, but basic evolutionary features, including the heritability of hydrocarbon profiles and how they are shaped by natural selection are largely unknown. We used a new pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis) laboratory mapping population to estimate the heritability of individual cuticular hydrocarbons, genetic correlations between hydrocarbons, and fitness consequences of phenotypic variation in the hydrocarbons. Individual hydrocarbons had low to moderate estimated heritability, indicating that some compounds provide more information about genetic relatedness and can also better respond to natural selection. Strong genetic correlations between compounds are likely to constrain independent evolutionary trajectories, which is expected given that many hydrocarbons share biosynthetic pathways. Variation in cuticular hydrocarbons was associated with variation in colony productivity, with some hydrocarbons experiencing strong directional selection. Altogether, this study builds on our knowledge of the genetic architecture of the social insect hydrocarbon profile and indicates that hydrocarbon variation is shaped by natural selection. </p>"

10.5281/zenodo.4926528,open,SCEC Community Geodetic Model (CGM),"<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The Community Geodetic Model (CGM) provides velocities of the Earth&rsquo;s surface over southern California using data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which includes the Global Positioning System (GPS), and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), both space-based geodetic observation techniques. The GNSS products provide high temporal resolution (nominally daily measurement points) in three dimensions at specific observation sites and the InSAR products provide high spatial resolution (up to one point per 30 m distance on the ground). Combined, they provide the ability to study crustal deformation over a wide range of distances and periods.</p>

<p>Please see <a href=""https://www.scec.org/research/cgm"">https://www.scec.org/research/cgm</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Model Version: CGM1</strong></p>

<p>This is the first major release of the CGM (version 1) and is distributed as a zip-file.&nbsp;See the README.txt file in the top directory of the archive for information about the directory structure and contents of the entire zipped archive. Much of the SCEC4 activity was focused on the assembly of GPS and InSAR data sets for measuring secular motions, comparing geodetically inferred fault slip rates with geological rates based on paleoseismic studies (e.g. <a href=""http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1165/"">UCERF3</a>) and using geodetic observations to detect and investigate transient deformation. The CGM1 is a time-independent set of products, consisting of velocities of the Earth&#39;s surface measured by GPS and InSAR, and derived horizontal velocity and strain rate fields interpolated from the geodetic data using a variety of methodologies. The preferred, average (mean) fields and the individual contributions from participating researchers are included in this version.</p>

10.5061/dryad.3bk3j9kf4,open,Data from: Methane emission offsets carbon dioxide uptake in a small productive lake,"<p>Here we investigate the importance of net CH<sub>4</sub> production and emissions in the carbon (C) budget of a small eutrophic lake by monitoring CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> during two consecutive years. During the study period, the lake was mostly a net emitter of both CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, while having a net autotrophic metabolism. The analyses suggest that during the whole study period 29 ± 23 % of C produced by net ecosystem production was ultimately converted to CH<sub>4</sub> and emitted to the atmosphere. When converted to global warming potential, CH<sub>4</sub> emission (in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents) was about 3 to 9 times higher than CO<sub>2</sub> uptake from in-lake net ecosystem production over 100-years and 20-year timeframes, respectively. Our results suggest that the continuing eutrophication of inland waters will increase the amount of C released from lakes as CH<sub>4</sub> instead of CO<sub>2&gt;</sub> and may exacerbate the lake's role in climate regulating processes.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.80gb5mknf,open,Radiation of tropical island bees and the role of phylogenetic niche conservatism as an important driver of biodiversity,"Island biogeography explores how biodiversity in island ecosystems arises and is maintained. The  topographical complexity of islands can drive speciation by providing a diversity of niches that promote adaptive radiation and speciation. However, recent studies have argued that phylogenetic niche conservatism, combined with topographical complexity and climate change, could also promote speciation if populations are episodically fragmented into climate refugia that enable allopatric speciation. Adaptive radiation and phylogenetic niche conservatism therefore both predict that topographical complexity should encourage speciation, but they differ strongly in their inferred mechanisms. Using genetic (mtDNA and SNP) and morphological data we show high species diversity (22 species) in an endemic clade of Fijian <i>Homalictus</i> bees, with most species restricted to highlands and frequently exhibiting narrow geographical ranges. Our results indicate that elevational niches have been conserved across most speciation events, contradicting expectations from an adaptive radiation model but concordant with phylogenetic niche conservatism. Climate cycles, topographical complexity, and niche conservatism could interact to shape island biodiversity. We argue that phylogenetic niche conservatism is an important driver of tropical bee biodiversity but that this phylogenetic inertia also leads to major extinction risks for tropical ectotherms under future warming climates."
10.6071/M3TT2J,open,Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) enamel phosphate δ18O values reflect climate seasonality: implications for paleoclimate reconstruction,"<p>Stable oxygen isotope compositions from vertebrate tooth enamel are commonly used as biogeochemical proxies for paleoclimate reconstructions. However, the utility of enamel isotopic values across species varies due to differences in rates of enamel deposition and mineralization as well as sources of ingested water, body water residence times, and species' physiology. We evaluate the use of stable oxygen isotope compositions from pronghorn (<em>Antilocapra americana</em> Gray, 1866) enamel for the amplitude reconstruction of terrestrial paleoclimate seasonality. We serially sampled the third lower molars of pronghorn from Wyoming for oxygen isotope composition in phosphate (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub>) and compared patterns to: (1) interpolated and (2) measured yearly variation in central Wyoming environmental waters (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>w</sub>) as well as to (3) δ<sup>18</sup>O values from sagebrush leaves and stems in the same region. Although we recognize the numerous factors influencing the composition of mammal body water, our null hypothesis was that δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub> enamel values reflect δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>w</sub> with a constant offset due to mammalian physiology. We set up our null hypothesis by converting δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>w</sub> values to δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub> using a published regression based on empirical results from mammals. Pronghorn δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub> values from enamel are consistently enriched in <sup>18</sup>O relative to the predicted values. We hypothesized that pronghorn δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub> values might also reflect dietary water and therefore also converted δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>leaf</sub> values from plants into predicted δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4 </sub>values. We infer that pronghorn obtain at least some of their water from <sup>18</sup>O-enriched plants because pronghorn enamel δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub> values are more similar to predicted δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub> values from plants than from meteoric waters. Modeling of source body water δ<sup>18</sup>O values show amplitudes between 70% and 95% of seasonal variation from Wyoming δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>w </sub>values. Collectively, our findings establish that modern seasonality in source water is reliably reflected in modern pronghorn enamel providing the basis for exploring changes in the amplitude of seasonality of ancient climates using archived tooth collections.</p>"
10.5061/dryad.crjdfn34d,open,Movement data of barnacle Chelonibia testudinaria,"<p>Movement is a fundamental characteristic of life, yet some taxa, such as barnacles, lose their capacity for locomotion as swimming larvae to become permanently affixed to a substratum as adults. Barnacles adopted this type of sessile life-stage at least 500 million years ago; however, we unequivocally confirm a prior report that the epizoic sea-turtle barnacle, <i>Chelonibia testudinaria</i>, has the capacity for self-directedlocomotion in the adult stage. We used time-series field and laboratory photographs to document its movement paired with transplant experiments employing various flow conditions and inter-individual configurations to test whether foraging or reproduction are ultimate causes of the activity. We also examined the barnacle cement microscopically for insight on its role in translocation. On loggerhead and green sea turtles, <i>C. testudinaria</i> moved distances up to 78.6 mm/year across its host substratum and in traverses on laboratory panels, occasionally altered course abruptly by 90<sup>o</sup>. Our findings indicate these movements are behaviourally directed and not passively driven by external forces. Barnacles tended to move directly against water flow and independent of nearby conspecifics, suggesting that movement functions primarily to facilitate foraging, not reproduction. While the mechanism enabling this movement remains elusive, we observed that trails of cement bore signs of multi-layered, episodic secretion. We speculate that proximal causes of movement involve one or a combination of rapid shell growth, cement secretion coordinated with basal membrane lifting, and directed contraction of basal perimeter muscles.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.5130612,open,PSML: A Multi-scale Time-series Dataset for Machine Learning in Decarbonized Energy Grids (Dataset),"<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>The electric grid is a key enabling infrastructure for the ambitious transition towards carbon neutrality as we grapple with climate change. With deepening penetration of renewable energy resources and electrified transportation, the reliable and secure operation of the electric grid becomes increasingly challenging. In this paper, we present PSML, a first-of-its-kind open-access multi-scale time-series dataset, to aid in the development of data-driven machine learning (ML) based approaches towards reliable operation of future electric grids. The dataset is generated through a novel transmission + distribution (T+D) co-simulation designed to capture the increasingly important interactions and uncertainties of the grid dynamics, containing electric load, renewable generation, weather, voltage and current measurements at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Using PSML, we provide state-of-the-art ML baselines on three challenging use cases of critical importance to achieve: (i) early detection, accurate classification and localization of dynamic disturbance events; (ii) robust hierarchical forecasting of load and renewable energy with the presence of uncertainties and extreme events; and (iii) realistic synthetic generation of physical-law-constrained measurement time series. We envision that this dataset will enable advances for ML in dynamic systems, while simultaneously allowing ML researchers to contribute towards carbon-neutral electricity and mobility.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>IEEE MLSP Data Challenge 2021</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>

<p>The <strong><a href=""https://www.l3das.com/mlsp2021"">L3DAS21 Challenge</a></strong> for the <strong><a href=""https://2021.ieeemlsp.org/"">IEEE MLSP 2021</a></strong> aims at encouraging and fostering research on machine learning for 3D audio signal processing. In multi-speaker scenarios it is very important to properly understand the nature of a sound event and its position within the environment, what is the content of the sound signal and how to leverage it at best for a specific application (e.g., teleconferencing rather than assistive listening or entertainment, among others). To this end, L3DAS21 Challenge presents two tasks: 3D Speech Enhancement and 3D Sound Event Localization and Detection, both relying on first-order Ambisonics recordings in reverberant office environment.</p>

<p>Each task involves 2 separate tracks: 1-mic and 2-mic recordings, respectively containing sounds acquired by one Ambisonics microphone and by an array of two Ambisonics microphones. The use of two first-order Ambisonics microphones definitely represents one of the main novelties of the L3DAS21 Challenge.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Task 1: 3D Speech Enhancement</strong><br>
	The objective of this task is the enhancement of speech signals immersed in the spatial sound field of a reverberant office environment. Here the models are expected to extract the monophonic voice signal from the 3D mixture containing various background noises.The evaluation metric for this task is a combination of the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) and word error rate (WER).<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Task 2: 3D Sound Event Localization and Detection</strong><br>
	The aim of this task is to detect the temporal activities of a known set of sound event classes and, in particular, to further locate them in the space.Here the models must predict a list of the active sound events and their respective location at regular intervals of 100 milliseconds. Performance on this task are evaluated according to the location-sensitive detection error, which joins the localization and detection errors.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DATASETS</strong></p>

<p>The LEDAS21 datasets contain multiple-source and multiple-perspective B-format Ambisonics audio recordings. We sampled the acoustic field of a large office room, placing two first-order Ambisonics microphones in the center of the room and moving a speaker reproducing the analytic signal in 252 fixed spatial positions. Relying on the collected Ambisonics impulse responses (IRs), we augmented existing clean monophonic datasets to obtain synthetic tridimensional sound sources by convolving the original sounds with our IRs. We extracted speech signals from the Librispeech dataset and office-like background noises from the FSD50K dataset. We aimed at creating plausible and variegate 3D scenarios to reflect possible real-life situations in which sound and disparate types of background noises coexist in the same 3D reverberant environment. We provide normalized raw waveforms as predictors data and the target data varies according to the task.</p>

<p>The dataset is divided in two main sections, respectively dedicated to the challenge tasks.</p>

<p>The first section is optimized for 3D Speech Enhancement and contains more than 30000 virtual 3D audio environments with a duration up to 10 seconds. In each sample, a spoken voice is always present alongside with other office-like background noises. As target data for this section we provide the clean monophonic voice signals.</p>

<p>The other sections, instead, is dedicated to the 3D Sound Event Localization and Detection task and contains 900 60-seconds-long audio files Each data point contains a simulated 3D office audio environment in which up to 3 simultaneous acoustic events may be active at the same time. In this section, the samples are not forced to contain a spoken voice.&nbsp; As target data for this section we provide a list of the onset and offset time stamps, the typology class, and the spatial coordinates of each individual sound event present in the data-points.</p>

<p>We split both dataset sections into: a training set (44 hours for SE and 600 hours for SELD) and a test set (6 hours for SE and 5 hours for SELD), paying attention to create similar distributions. The train set of the SE section is divided in two partitions: train360 and train100, and contain speech samples extracted from the correspondent partitions of Librispeech (only the sample) up to 10 seconds). All sets of the SELD section are divided in: OV1, OV2, OV3. These partitions refer to the maximum amount of possible overlapping sounds, which are 1, 2 ore 3, respectively.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.582651,open,"MARSIS surface clutter simulations over Lucus Planun, Mars","<p>Mars Express MARSIS radargram simulations over Lucus Planum (Mars)</p>

<p>This archive contains simulations of radar surface scattering for the MARSIS low-frequency radar over the area of Lucus Planum.</p>

<p>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a well-established geophysical technique employed for more than five decades to investigate the terrestrial subsurface. It is based on the transmission of radar pulses at frequencies in the MF, HF and VHF portions of the electromagnetic spectrum into the surface, to detect reflected signals from subsurface structures (see e.g. Bogorodsky et al. 1985). Orbiting GPR have been successfully employed in planetary exploration (Phillips et al. 1973, Picardi et al. 2004, Seu et al. 2007, Ono et al. 2009), and are often called subsurface radar sounders. By detecting dielectric discontinuities associated with compositional and/or structural discontinuities, radar sounders are the only remote sensing instruments allowing the study of the subsurface of a planet from orbit.</p>

<p>MARSIS is a synthetic-aperture, orbital sounding radar carried by the European Space Agency spacecraft Mars Express (Picardi et al. 2005). MARSIS is optimized for deep penetration, having detected echoes down to a depth of 3.7 km over the South Polar Layered Deposits (Plaut el al. 2007). MARSIS transmits through a dipole, which has negligible directivity, with the consequence that the radar pulse illuminates the entire surface beneath the spacecraft and not only the near-nadir portion from which subsurface echoes are expected. The electromagnetic wave can then be scattered by any roughness of the surface.</p>

<p>If the surface of the body being sounded is not smooth at the wavelength scale, i.e. if the r.m.s. of topographic heights is greater than a fraction of the wavelength, then part of the incident radiation will be scattered in directions different from the specular one. This means that areas of the surface that are not directly beneath the radar can scatter part of the incident radiation back towards it, and thus produce surface echoes that will reach the radar after the echo coming from nadir, which can mask, or be mistaken for, subsurface echoes. This surface backscattering from off-nadir directions is called ""clutter"".</p>

<p>To validate the detection of subsurface interfaces, numerical electromagnetic models of surface scattering, such as those by Nouvel et al. (2004), Russo et al. (2008) or Spagnuolo et al. (2011), have been used to produce simulations of surface echoes, which are then compared to real echoes detected by the radar. A code for the simulation of radar wave surface scattering has been developed, based on the work of Nouvel et al. (2004), using the MOLA topographic dataset (Smith et al. 2001) to represent the Martian surface as a collection of flat plates called facets. The radar echo is computed as the coherent sum of reflections from all facets illuminated by the radar. The computational burden of every simulation is very high but, thanks to a collaboration with CINECA, the code has been parallelized and ported for use in a Blue Gene/Q system. The code has been tested and its performance evaluated on the Fermi machine at CINECA.</p>

<p>The data included in this archive simulate MARSIS observations over the area of Lucus Planum, in the equatorial region of Mars, and have been used in the paper ""Radar sounding of Lucus Planum, Mars, by MARSIS"" by  Orosei, Rossi, Cantini, Caprarelli, Carter, Papiano, Cartacci, Cicchetti and Noschese, accepted for pubblication on Journal of Geophysical Research - Planets. A direct comparison of simulations with actual observations allows to unambiguously identify subsurface echoes in MARSIS radargrams. Echoes reaching the radar after nadir surface echoes will be identified as coming from the subsurface if they are not present in simulations. Conversely, any secondary echo that is present in both real and simulated data must be interpreted as coming from the surface.</p>

<p>The numerical code for the simulation of surface scattering was developed at the Consorzio Interuniversitario per il Calcolo Automatico dell'Italia Nord-Orientale (CINECA) in Bologna, Italy. Simulations were produced thanks to the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE), awarding us access to the SuperMUC computer at the Leibniz-Rechenzentrum, Garching, Germany through project 2013091832. Test simulations were run Jacobs University CLAMV HPC cluster, and we are grateful to Achim Gelessus for his support.</p>

10.5061/dryad.kj666,open,"Data from: Diverse mechanisms of metaeffector activity in an intracellular bacterial pathogen, Legionella pneumophila","Pathogens deliver complex arsenals of translocated effector proteins to host cells during infection, but the extent to which these proteins are regulated once inside the eukaryotic cell remains poorly defined. Among all bacterial pathogens, Legionella pneumophila maintains the largest known set of translocated substrates, delivering over 300 proteins to the host cell via its Type IVB, Icm/Dot translocation system. Backed by a few notable examples of effector–effector regulation in L. pneumophila, we sought to define the extent of this phenomenon through a systematic analysis of effector–effector functional interaction. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an established proxy for the eukaryotic host, to query &gt; 108,000 pairwise genetic interactions between two compatible expression libraries of ~330 L. pneumophila‐translocated substrates. While capturing all known examples of effector–effector suppression, we identify fourteen novel translocated substrates that suppress the activity of other bacterial effectors and one pair with synergistic activities. In at least nine instances, this regulation is direct—a hallmark of an emerging class of proteins called metaeffectors, or ""effectors of effectors"". Through detailed structural and functional analysis, we show that metaeffector activity derives from a diverse range of mechanisms, shapes evolution, and can be used to reveal important aspects of each cognate effector's function. Metaeffectors, along with other, indirect, forms of effector–effector modulation, may be a common feature of many intracellular pathogens—with unrealized potential to inform our understanding of how pathogens regulate their interactions with the host cell."
10.5061/dryad.ttdz08kw6,open,Variation in plant leaf traits affects transmission and detectability of herbivore vibrational cues,"<p>Many insects use plant-borne vibrations to obtain important information about their environment, such as where to find a mate or a prey, or when to avoid a predator. Plant species can differ in the way they vibrate, possibly affecting the reliability of information, and ultimately the decisions that are made by animals based on this information. We examined whether the production, transmission and possible perception of plant-borne vibrational cues is affected by variation in leaf traits. We recorded vibrations of 69 <i>Spodoptera exigua</i> caterpillars foraging on four plant species that differed widely in their leaf-traits (cabbage, beetroot, sunflower and corn). We carried out a transmission and an airborne noise absorption experiment to assess whether leaf traits influence amplitude and frequency characteristics, and background noise levels of vibrational-chewing cues. Our results reveal that species-specific leaf traits can influence transmission and potentially perception of herbivore-induced chewing vibrations. Experimentally-induced vibrations attenuated stronger on plants with thicker leaves. Amplitude and frequency characteristics of chewing vibrations measured near a chewing caterpillar were, however, not affected by leaf traits. Furthermore, we found a significant effect of leaf area, water content and leaf thickness - important plant traits against herbivory, on the vibrations induced by airborne noise. On larger leaves higher amplitude vibrations were induced, whereas on thicker leaves containing more water airborne noise induced higher peak frequencies. Our findings indicate that variation in leaf traits can be important for the transmission and possibly detection of vibrational cues.</p>"
10.5281/zenodo.4706907,open,Stereo Instances on Surfaces (STIOS),"<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Stereo Instances on Surfaces Dataset (STIOS)</strong>&nbsp;is created for evaluation of instance-based algorithms. It is a representative dataset to achieve uniform comparability for instance detection and segmentation with different input modalities (RGB, RGB-D, stereo RGB). STIOS is mainly intended for robotic applications (e.g. object manipulation), which is why the dataset refers to horizontal surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Sensors</strong></p>

<p>STIOS contains recordings from two different sensors: a&nbsp;<a href=""https://roboception.com/product/rc_visard-65-color/"">rc_visard 65 color</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.stereolabs.com/zed/"">Stereolabs ZED camera</a>. Aside stereo RGB (left and right RGB image), the internally generated depth maps are also saved for both sensors. In addition, the&nbsp;<em>ZED</em>&nbsp;sensor provides normal images and point cloud data which are also provided in STIOS. Since some objects / surfaces have little texture and this would have a negative impact on the quality of the depth map, an additional LED projector with a random point pattern is used when recording the depth images (only used for&nbsp;<em>rc_visard 65 color</em>). Consequently, for the&nbsp;<em>rc_visard 65 color</em>&nbsp;STIOS includes RGB images and the resulting depth maps with and without a projected pattern.</p>

<p>The large number of different input modalities should enable evaluation of a wide variety of methods. As you can see in the picture, the&nbsp;<em>ZED</em>&nbsp;sensor was mounted above the&nbsp;<em>rc_visard 65</em>&nbsp;lenses to get a similar viewing angle. This enables an evaluation between the sensors, whereby comparisons can be made about the generalization of a method with regard to sensors or the quality of the input modality.</p>

<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>

<p>The dataset contains the following objects from the YCB video dataset and thus covers several application areas such as unknown instance segmentation, instance detection and segmentation (detection + classification):</p>

<p>003_cracker_box, 005_tomato_soup_can, 006_mustard_bottle, 007_tuna_fish_can, 008_pudding_box, 010_potted_meat_can, 011_banana, 019_pitcher_base, 021_bleach_cleanser, 024_bowl, 025_mug, 035_power_drill, 037_scissors, 052_extra_large_clamp, 061_foam_brick.</p>

<p>Due to the widespread use of these objects in robotic applications there are 3D models for each of the objects which can be used to generate synthetic training data for e.g. instance detection based on RGB-D. In order to guarantee an evenly distributed occurrence of the 15 objects, 4-6 random objects are selected by machine for each sample. The alignment of the objects is either&nbsp;<em>easy</em>&nbsp;(objects do not touch) or&nbsp;<em>difficult</em>&nbsp;(objects may touch or lie on top of each other).</p>

<p><strong>Surroundings</strong></p>

<p>The data set contains 8 different environments in order to cover the variation of environmental parameters such as lighting, background or scene surfaces. Scenes for the data set were recorded in the following environments: office carpet, workbench, white table, wooden table, conveyor belt, lab floor, wooden plank und tool cabinet.</p>

<p>The scenes where chosen carefully to ensure that they contain surfaces that are both friendly as well as challenging to stereo sensors. STIOS therefore contains low-texture surfaces (e.g. white table, conveyor belt) and texture-rich surfaces (e.g. lab floor, wooden plank). The above-mentioned variations of the surfaces and environments allows to evaluate methods in terms of robustness against and generalization to various environmental parameters.</p>

<p>For each scene surface, 3 easy and 3 difficult samples are generated from 4 manually set camera angles (approx. 0.3-1m distance). As the illustration shows, even with light object alignment the objects can occlude each other in some camera angles. The 6 samples per camera setting result in 24 samples per environment for each sensor, which results in a total of 192 samples per sensor.</p>

<p><strong>Annotations</strong></p>

<p>For each of these samples (192x2) all object instances in the left camera image were annotated manually (instance mask + object class). The annotations are available in the form of 8-bit grayscale images, which represent the semantic classes in the image. Since each object appears only once in the image, object instance masks can also be obtained from this format at the same time.</p>

<p>The dataset is structured as follows:</p>

<pre><code>STIOS
|--rc_visard
|  |--conveyor_belt
|  |  |--left_rgb
|  |  |--right_rgb
|  |  |--gt
|  |  |--depth

|  |  |--gt
|  |  |--depth
|  |  |--normals
|  |  |--pcd
|  |--lab_floor
|  |--...</code></pre>

<p>We also provide code utilities which allow visualization of images and annotations of STIOS and contain various utility functions to e.g. generate bounding box annotations from the semantic grayscale images.

<p>This method enables the segmentation of unknown object instances that are located on horizontal surfaces (e.g. tables, floors, etc.). Due to the often incomplete depth data in robotic applications, stereo RGB images are used here. On the one hand, STIOS is employed to show the functionality of stereo images for unknown instance segmentation, and on the other hand, to make a comparison with existing work, which for the most part directly access depth data.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.4590294,open,Virtual cohort of adult healthy four-chamber heart meshes from CT images,"<p><strong>Dataset Description:&nbsp;</strong>We present the first database of four-chamber healthy heart models suitable for electro-mechanical (EM) simulations. Our database consists of twenty&nbsp;four-chamber heart models generated from end-diastolic CT acquired from patients who went&nbsp;to the emergency room with acute chest pains. Since no cardiac conditions were detected in follow-up, these patients were taken as representative of &quot;healthy&quot;&nbsp;(or asymptomatic) hearts. These meshes were used for EM simulations and to build a statistical shape model (SSM). The output of the simulations and the weights of the SSM&nbsp;are also provided.</p>

<p><strong>Cardiac meshes:&nbsp;</strong>We segmented end-diastolic CT. The segmentation was then upsampled and smoothed. The final multi-label segmentation was used to generate a tetrahedral mesh. The resulting meshes had an average edge length of 1 mm. The elements of all the twenty&nbsp;meshes are labelled as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Left ventricle myocardium</li>
	<li>Right ventricle myocardium</li>
	<li>Left atrium myocardium</li>

</ol>

<p>Ventricular fibres were generated using a rule-based method, with a fibre orientation varying transmurally from endocardium to epicardium from 80˚ to -60˚, respectively.&nbsp; We defined a system of universal ventricular coordinates on the meshes: an apico-basal coordinate (Z) varying continuously from 0 at the apex to 1 at the base (defined with the mitral and tricuspid valve);&nbsp;a transmural coordinate (<span class=""math-tex"">\(\rho\)</span>) varying continuously from 0 at the endocardium to 1 at the epicardium; a rotational coordinate (<span class=""math-tex"">\(\phi\)</span>) varying continuously from &ndash; &pi; at the left ventricular free wall, 0 at the septum and then back to + &pi; at the left ventricular free wall; intra-ventricular coordinate (V)&nbsp;defined at -1 at the left ventricle and +1 at the right ventricle. This coordinate system was assigned to the ventricles in the four-chamber meshes and all the other labels were assigned with -10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We provide a zipped folder for each mesh, A VTK&nbsp;file for each mesh was included (in ASCII) as an UNSTRUCTURED GRID. In all the cases the following fields were included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>POINTS, with the coordinates of the points in mm.</li>
	<li>CELL_TYPES, having all of the points the value 10&nbsp;since they are tetrahedra.</li>
	<li>CELLS, with the indices of the vertices of every element.</li>
	<li>CELL_DATA, corresponding to the meshing tags.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>VECTORS,&nbsp;with the directions of the fibres.</li>
	<li>POINT_DATA,&nbsp;with four LOOKUP_TABLE&nbsp;subfields corresponding to the UVC in the order <span class=""math-tex"">\(\rho\)</span>, <span class=""math-tex"">\(\phi\)</span>, Z and V.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cardiac simulations:&nbsp;</strong>For the cardiac EM simulations we used CARP (Cardiac Arrhythmia Research Package). We used the reaction-eikonal model for electrophysiology, stimulating as initial condition the bottom third (Z &lt; 0.33) of the endocardium. We simulated the large deformation mechanics in a Lagrangian reference system. The ventricular myocardium was modelled as a hyperelastic transversely isotropic material with Guccione&#39;s strain energy function.&nbsp;The remaining tissues were modelled as non-contracting neo-Hookean materials. Simulations of meshes #09 and #10 failed to converge. Details on the specific parametrisation can be found in the supplements of the reference paper.</p>

<p>We provide comma-separated-values files&nbsp;with the output of the simulations used in the reference paper for validation purposes. The simulations of the cases that did not converge were not included.&nbsp;The acronyms used in the names of columns are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>EDP: End-diastolic pressure</li>
	<li>EDV: End-diastolic volume</li>
	<li>Myo_vol: Myocardial volume of the ventricle (as sum of its elements)</li>
	<li>ESV:&nbsp;End-systolic volume</li>
	<li>SV:&nbsp;Stroke volume&nbsp;</li>

	<li>AT: Activation time of the left ventricle</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the output value name, in each column is specified the ventricle where that output was extracted from with the suffixes &quot;_LV&quot; or &quot;_RV&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical shape model:&nbsp;</strong>All the meshes but #20 were used to build a statistical shape model of four-chambers cardiac meshes.&nbsp;In short, we rigidly aligned the meshes and extracted the surfaces, representing them as deRham currents.&nbsp;The registration between meshes and computation of the average shape (also called atlas or template) was done using a Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping method. Each one of the meshes can be approximated as a linear combination of the shape modes, extracted using Principal Component Analysis on the space where the meshes are located. More details on the Statistical Shape Model are provided in the supplement of the reference paper.&nbsp;The average heart and extreme cases are provided in the repository named &quot;Virtual cohort of extreme and average four-chamber heart meshes from statistical shape model&quot;.&nbsp;We have added 1000 more meshes from the same statistical shape model, modifying the weights from the PCA randomly within the 2SD range. These meshes&nbsp;are provided in the repository named &quot;Virtual cohort of 1000 synthetic heart meshes from the adult human healthy population&quot;.</p>

10.5061/dryad.gf1vhhmn9,open,Adaptive trait syndromes along multiple economic spectra define cold and warm adapted ecotypes in a widely distributed foundation tree species,"<p>1. The coordination of traits from individual organs to whole plants is under strong selection because of environmental constraints on resource acquisition and use. However, the tight coordination of traits may provide underlying mechanisms of how locally adapted plant populations can become maladapted because of climate change. 2. To better understand local adaptation in intraspecific trait coordination, we studied trait variability in the widely distributed foundation tree species, Populus fremontii using a common garden near the mid-elevational point of this species distribution. We examined 28 traits encompassing four spectra: phenology, leaf economic spectrum (LES), whole-tree architecture (Corner's Rule), and wood economic spectrum (WES). 3. Based on adaptive syndrome theory, we hypothesized that trait expression would be coordinated among and within trait spectra, reflecting local adaptation to either exposure to freeze-thaw conditions in genotypes sourced from high-elevation populations or exposure to extreme thermal stress in genotypes sourced from low-elevation populations. 4. High-elevation genotypes expressed traits within the phenology and WES that limit frost exposure and tissue damage. Specifically, genotypes sourced from high elevations had later mean budburst, earlier mean budset, higher wood densities, higher bark fractions, and smaller xylem vessels than their low-elevation counterparts. Conversely, genotypes sourced from low elevations expressed traits within the LES that prioritized hydraulic efficiency and canopy thermal regulation to cope with extreme heat exposure, including 40% smaller leaf areas, 67% higher stomatal densities, and 34% higher mean theoretical maximum stomatal conductance. Low-elevation genotypes also expressed a lower stomatal control over leaf water potentials that subsequently dropped to pressures that could induce hydraulic failure. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that P. fremontii expresses a high degree of coordination across multiple trait spectra to adapt to local climate constraints on photosynthetic gas exchange, growth, and survival. These results, therefore, increase our mechanistic understanding of local adaptation and the potential effects of climate change that in turn, improves our capacity to identify genotypes that are best suited for future restoration efforts.</p>"

The number of classes differ for the two latter as they depend on the minimum number of individuals considered (4 and 10 individuals per class respectively). Trees positions have been acquired using differential GPS and are given with centimetric to decimetric precision. A randomly selected subset of these trees has been used to train machine SVM and Random Forest classification algorithms. Those algorithms were applied to hyperspectral images using a number of classes for family (12 &amp; 19 classes) and species (14 &amp; 27 classes) levels defined according to the minimum number of individuals considered during training/validation process (4 and 10 individuals per class, respectively). Global classification precision for several training subsets is given by Brabant et al, 2019 (<a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/470202"">https://www.mdpi.com/470202</a>) in terms of averaged overall accuracy (AOA) and averaged kappa index of agreement (AKIA).</li>

First, a spatially resampled 1.6 m VNIR image was built, where output pixel values were calculated as the average of the VNIR 0.8 m pixel values that spatially contribute to it. Then, ground control points (GCP) were selected over both images and SWIR one was tied to the VNIR 1.6 m image using a bilinear resampling method using ENVI tool.

10.5281/zenodo.5789064,open,AIT Log Data Set V2.0,"<p><strong>AIT Log Data Sets</strong></p>

<p>This repository contains synthetic log data suitable for evaluation of intrusion detection systems, federated learning, and alert aggregation. A detailed description of the dataset is available in [1]. The logs were collected from eight testbeds that were built at the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) following the approach by [2]. Please cite these papers if the data is used for academic publications.</p>

<p>In brief, each of the datasets corresponds to a testbed representing a small enterprise network including mail server, file share, WordPress server, VPN, firewall, etc. Normal user behavior is simulated to generate background noise over a time span of 4-6 days. At some point, a sequence of attack steps are launched against the network. Log data is collected from all hosts and includes Apache access and error logs, authentication logs, DNS logs, VPN logs, audit logs, Suricata logs, network traffic packet captures, horde logs, exim logs, syslog, and system monitoring logs. Separate ground truth files are used to label events that are related to the attacks. Compared to the <a href=""https://zenodo.org/record/4264796"">AIT-LDSv1.1</a>, a more complex network and diverse user behavior is simulated, and logs are collected from all hosts in the network.</p>

<p>The datasets have the following structure:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <em>gather </em>directory contains all logs collected from the testbed. Logs collected from each host are located in <em>gather/&lt;host_name&gt;/logs/</em>.</li>
	<li>The <em>labels </em>directory contains the ground truth of the dataset that indicates which events are related to attacks. The directory mirrors the structure of the gather directory so that each label files is located at the same path and has the same name as the corresponding log file. Each line in the label files references the log event corresponding to an attack by the line number counted from the beginning of the file (&quot;line&quot;), the labels assigned to the line that state the respective attack step (&quot;labels&quot;), and the labeling rules that assigned the labels (&quot;rules&quot;).</li>
	<li>The <em>processing </em>directory contains the source code that was used to generate the labels.</li>
	<li>The <em>rules </em>directory contains the labeling rules.</li>
	<li>The <em>environment </em>directory contains the source code that was used to deploy the testbed and run the simulation using the <a href=""https://github.com/ait-aecid/kyoushi-environment"">Kyoushi Testbed Environment</a>.</li>
	<li>The <em>dataset.yml</em> file specifies the start and end time of the simulation.</li>

<p>The following attacks are launched in the network:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Scans (nmap, WPScan, dirb)</li>
	<li>Webshell upload (CVE-2020-24186)</li>
	<li>Password cracking (John the Ripper)</li>
	<li>Privilege escalation</li>
	<li>Remote command execution</li>
	<li>Data exfiltration (DNSteal)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that attack parameters and their execution orders vary in each dataset. Labeled log files are trimmed to the simulation time to ensure that their labels (which reference the related event by the line number in the file) are not misleading. Other log files, however, also contain log events generated before or after the simulation time and may therefore be affected by testbed setup or data collection. It is therefore recommended to only consider logs with timestamps within the simulation time for analysis.</p>

<p>Beside the attack labels, a general overview of the exact times when specific attack steps are launched are available in <em>gather/attacker_0/logs/attacks.log</em>. An enumeration of all hosts and their IP addresses is stated in processing/config/servers.yml. Moreover, configurations of each host are provided in <em>gather/&lt;host_name&gt;/configs/</em> and <em>gather/&lt;host_name&gt;/facts.json</em>.</p>

10.5281/zenodo.4593739,open,Virtual cohort of extreme and average four-chamber heart meshes from statistical shape model,"<p><strong>Dataset Description:&nbsp;</strong>We present a&nbsp;database of four-chamber&nbsp;heart models derived from a statistical shape model (SSM) suitable for electro-mechanical (EM) simulations. Our database consists of 39 four-chamber heart models generated from end-diastolic CT-derived meshes (available in the repository called (&quot;Virtual cohort of adult healthy four-chamber heart meshes from CT images&quot;). These meshes were used for EM simulations. The output of the simulations and the weights of the SSM are also provided.</p>

<p><strong>Cardiac meshes</strong>: To<strong>&nbsp;</strong>build&nbsp;the SSM, we rigidly aligned the CT cohort and extracted the surfaces, representing them as deRham currents. The registration between meshes and computation of the average shape&nbsp;was done using a Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping method. The deformation functions depend on a set of uniformly distributed control points in which the shapes are embedded, and on the deformation vectors attached to these points. It is in this spatial field of deformation vectors (one per each control point) where the Principal Component Analysis&nbsp;is applied. Case #20 of the CT cohort was not included. More information on the details can be found in Supplement 3 of the reference paper. We created two extra cohorts by modifying the weight of the modes explaining 90%of the variance in shape (corresponding to modes 1 to 9). We created these meshes with either &plusmn;2 or &plusmn;3 standard deviations (SD) of each mode added to the average mesh (extreme2 and extreme3 cohorts respectively). We also created two additional meshes with &plusmn;1 SD for mode 2 (extreme1 cohort).&nbsp;The elements of all the meshes are labelled as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Left ventricle myocardium</li>
	<li>Right ventricle myocardium</li>
	<li>Left atrium myocardium</li>
	<li>Right atrium myocardium</li>
	<li>Aorta wall</li>
	<li>Pulmonary artery wall</li>
	<li>Mitral valve plane</li>
	<li>Tricuspid valve plane</li>
	<li>Aortic valve plane</li>
	<li>Pulmonary valve plane</li>
	<li>Left atrium appendage &quot;inlet&quot;</li>
	<li>Left superior pulmonary vein inlet</li>
	<li>Left inferior pulmonary vein inlet</li>
	<li>Right inferior pulmonary vein inlet</li>
	<li>Right superior pulmonary vein inlet</li>
	<li>Superior vena cava inlet</li>
	<li>Inferior vena cava inlet</li>
	<li>Left atrial appendage border</li>
	<li>Right inferior pulmonary vein border</li>
	<li>Left inferior pulmonary vein border</li>
	<li>Left superior pulmonary vein border</li>
	<li>Right superior pulmonary vein border</li>
	<li>Superior vena cava border</li>
	<li>Inferior vena cava border</li>
</ol>

<p>Ventricular fibres were generated using a rule-based method, with a fibre orientation varying transmurally from endocardium to epicardium from 80˚ to -60˚, respectively.&nbsp; We defined a system of universal ventricular coordinates on the meshes: an apico-basal coordinate (Z) varying continuously from 0 at the apex to 1 at the base (defined with the mitral and tricuspid valve);&nbsp;a transmural coordinate (<span class=""math-tex"">\(\rho\)</span>) varying continuously from 0 at the endocardium to 1 at the epicardium; a rotational coordinate (<span class=""math-tex"">\(\phi\)</span>) varying continuously from &ndash; &pi; at the left ventricular free wall, 0 at the septum and then back to + &pi; at the left ventricular free wall; intra-ventricular coordinate (V)&nbsp;defined at -1 at the left ventricle and +1 at the right ventricle. This coordinate system was assigned to the ventricles in the four-chamber meshes and all the other labels were assigned with -10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We provide a zipped folder for each mesh, A VTK&nbsp;file for each mesh was included (in ASCII) as an UNSTRUCTURED GRID. In all the cases the following fields were included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>POINTS, with the coordinates of the points in mm.</li>
	<li>CELL_TYPES, having all of the points the value 10&nbsp;since they are tetrahedra.</li>
	<li>CELLS, with the indices of the vertices of every element.</li>
	<li>CELL_DATA, corresponding to the meshing tags.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>VECTORS,&nbsp;with the directions of the fibres.</li>
	<li>POINT_DATA,&nbsp;with four LOOKUP_TABLE&nbsp;subfields corresponding to the UVC in the order <span class=""math-tex"">\(\rho\)</span>, <span class=""math-tex"">\(\phi\)</span>, Z and V.</li>
</ul>

<p>We provide the average mesh, and the extreme1, extreme2 and extreme3 cohorts. These correspond to the files of the form modeX&plusmn;1SD for extreme 1, modeX&plusmn;2SD for extreme2 and modeX&plusmn;3SD for extreme3. These meshes have been used to interpret the anatomical meaning of modifying each mode.</p>

<p><strong>Cardiac simulations:&nbsp;</strong>For the cardiac EM simulations we used CARP (Cardiac Arrhythmia Research Package). We used the reaction-eikonal model for electrophysiology, stimulating as initial condition the bottom third (Z &lt; 0.33) of the endocardium. We simulated the large deformation mechanics in a Lagrangian reference system. The ventricular myocardium was modelled as a hyperelastic transversely isotropic material with Guccione&#39;s strain energy function.&nbsp;The remaining tissues were modelled as non-contracting neo-Hookean materials. Simulations diverged for cases mode2-3SD, mode3+3SD, mode6-3SD, mode9-3SD and mode2-2SD&nbsp;. Details on the specific parametrisation can be found in the supplements of the reference paper.</p>

<p>We provide comma-separated-values files&nbsp;with the output of the simulations used in the reference paper for validation purposes. The simulations of the cases that did not converge were not included.&nbsp;The acronyms used in the names of columns are:</p>

10.5281/zenodo.6321327,open,Deformation composite of the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS) Lagrangian motion data,"<p>Deformation composite constructed from the Lagrangian RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS) Lagrangian motion data for January-February-March, 1997 to 2008.&nbsp;The nominal temporal and spatial scales for the composite data are&nbsp;T<sup>*</sup> = 3 days, and L<sup>*</sup> = 10 km. This data is analyzed and compared with model deformation statistics in&nbsp;Bouchat et al., Sea Ice Rheology Experiment (SIREx), Part I: Scaling and statistical properties of sea-ice deformation fields, Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans (2022).</p>

<p>The original RGPS Lagrangian motion data set consists in lists of trajectories (time and positions records) for points that are tracked in sequential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The trajectories are organized in different &ldquo;streams&rdquo;, corresponding to different initial satellite passes over which a set of tracked points were initialized. For all streams, the trajectories are initialized on a&nbsp;uniform 10 km x 10 km grid at the beginning of the winter in November.&nbsp;Each tracked point&nbsp;can therefore be assigned to&nbsp;<em>(i,j)</em>&nbsp;indices corresponding to its initialization location on the grid. As time increases and&nbsp;the position records are updated, the tracked points are no longer uniformly separated, but their assigned&nbsp;<em>(i,j)</em>&nbsp;indices do not change.&nbsp;The trajectory records are updated when the tracking algorithm detects the tracked points in a new SAR image. The update interval is therefore not always the same for all&nbsp;points, nor is it always on the same time/day within a given stream as the tracking algorithm may be unsuccessful for certain images/points. Moreover, the multiple streams can overlap spatially, such that more than one trajectory can be assigned to the same<em>&nbsp;(i,j)</em>&nbsp;indices. Computing&nbsp;strain rates directly&nbsp;from the original RGPS Lagrangian motion product therefore results in deformation estimates that can span a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, that are not temporally coherent across all streams,&nbsp;and that can also be spatially&nbsp;redundant.&nbsp;The goal of constructing a deformation composite from the&nbsp;original RGPS Lagrangian motion product is to generate a coherent set of&nbsp;non-overlapping&nbsp;Lagrangian deformation estimates at fixed time intervals and with a uniform spatial scale that can be used&nbsp;for statistical analysis.</p>

<p>The RGPS Lagrangian deformation composite is constructed using the weighted-average pre-processing method described in&nbsp;Bouchat &amp; Tremblay&nbsp;(2020) and&nbsp;Hutter et al.&nbsp;(2020) and summarized here. For each stream separately, we first define quadrilateral Lagrangian cells assigned to the&nbsp;<em>(i,j)</em>&nbsp;indices by&nbsp;combining records from the&nbsp;<em>(i,j),</em>&nbsp;<em>(i+1,j)</em>,&nbsp;<em>(i,j+1)</em>, and&nbsp;<em>(i+1, j+1)</em>&nbsp;available&nbsp;Lagrangian trajectories. For each&nbsp;<em>(i,j)&nbsp;</em>cell,&nbsp;we then compute the&nbsp;Lagrangian strain rates if,&nbsp;between any two update times, the cell&#39;s records&nbsp;have: (i)&nbsp;simultaneous (plus or minus 3 hours) start and end times for all fours corners, (ii) an average time interval for all corners that corresponds to the nominal temporal resolution of T<sup>*</sup>= 3 days, and (iii) an&nbsp;area at the start time that corresponds&nbsp;to the nominal spatial resolution of L<sup>*</sup>= 10 km. The strain rates, the cell area, and the start and end times used to compute the cell&#39;s strain rates are also assigned to the&nbsp;<em>(i,j)&nbsp;</em>indices. Then, to create the composite deformation estimates at the same&nbsp;fixed start and end dates for all cells, we&nbsp;average the strain rate and area records at&nbsp;each&nbsp;<em>(i,j)</em>&nbsp;indices in fixed 3-day periods starting on January 1st, using the overlapping time between their start/end date interval&nbsp;with the fixed 3-day periods as weight. For visualization purposes only, we also average the cells&#39; corners&#39; starting positions from all records overlapping with the fixed 3-day interval and use these averaged positions as approximate coordinates for the composite deformation cells.&nbsp;Finally, all streams are spatially combined into a single strain rate composite.&nbsp;In the case of spatial overlap between two or more streams, we keep the cells that have the longest time coverage and discard the other ones.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is one netCDF file per&nbsp;year. Data are organized in matrices where the <em>(i,j)</em> indices are the Lagrangian cells identifier. This allows us to keep&nbsp;track of neighbouring cells for the scaling analysis. See below for more information on what variables are included in the files and&nbsp;their structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Variables included</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>(x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4)</em>: Average positions of the composite cells&#39; corners. Used for visualization only (deformations should not be computed using these positions) - (meters);</li>
	<li><em>A</em>: Composite cells&#39; area - (meters squared);</li>
	<li><em>dudx, dudy, dvdx, dvdy</em>: Composite cell&#39;s&nbsp;velocity derivatives (strain rates/deformation) - (1/seconds);</li>
	<li><em>d_dudx, d_dudy, d_dvdx, d_dvdy</em>: Trajectory error on the composite cells&#39;&nbsp;velocity derivatives - (1/seconds);</li>
	<li><em>time</em>: Day of year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>*Note:</strong>&nbsp;The composite cells were removed if their average position was within 100 km from land. Before comparing the deformation statistics with sea-ice models, one should only keep cells available in both the model and the RGPS composite.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Variable structure</strong></p>

<p>All variables (except <em>time</em>) are matrices with axes (<em>it, i, j&nbsp;</em>), where <em>it</em> is the time stamp/iteration and<em> i,j </em>are the cells identifiers. See below for how the cells are defined:&nbsp;</p>

10.5061/dryad.7wm37pvpp,open,Genomic and phenotypic evolution of Escherichia coli in a novel citrate-only resource environment,"Evolutionary innovations allow populations to colonize new ecological niches. We previously reported that aerobic growth on citrate (Cit+) evolved in an Escherichia coli population during adaptation to a minimal glucose medium containing citrate (DM25). Cit+ variants can also grow in citrate-only medium (DM0), a novel environment for E. coli. To study adaptation to this niche, we founded two sets of Cit+ populations and evolved them for 2500 generations in DM0 or DM25. The evolved lineages acquired numerous parallel mutations, many mediated by transposable elements. Several also evolved amplifications of regions containing the maeA gene. Unexpectedly, some evolved populations and clones show apparent declines in fitness. We also found evidence of substantial cell death in Cit+ clones. Our results thus demonstrate rapid trait refinement and adaptation to the new citrate niche, while also suggesting a recalcitrant mismatch between E. coli physiology and growth on citrate."

The algorithm used, i.e. SARWIND LG-Mod ver. v4.01 (see reference below), is aimed at producing the Sea Surface Wind (SSW), i.e. Speed and Direction, from a single co-polarized (VV or HH) SAR image. We used EW (Extended Wide) and IW (Interferometric Wide) Swath Mode GRD (Ground Range, Multi-Look, Detected) HR (High Resolution) Sentinel-1 images, with pixel spacings of 40m x 40m and 10m x 10m (azimuth x range) respectively. Associated auxiliary products were obtained from ESA SNAP 5.0 release. SSW fields were provided for the two coastal Protected Areas (PAs) named Camargue and Wadden Sea.</p>

<p>Each output folder of the SARWIND LG-Mod results contains useful plots and the estimated SSW field, provided in the file &#39;SAR_Sigma0_pp_decimationL2P2Tn_gradientOptSobel_LGMod_Results.txt&#39; (pp = VV or HH; n = smoothing/decimation level), which is in the sub-folder &#39;LG-Mod_Theoretical_Results/Results_MEdegTHxx.xxx_Fisher (where xx.xxx is the final threshold applied). This txt file reports the following 19 columns:</p>

<p><br>
1) LAT; 2) LON; 3) AZI; 4) RNG; [Location of the centre of the processed AOI]</p>

<p>5) REF_U; 6) REF_V; 7) REF_W; 8) REF_D; [ECMWF reference wind, as U/V components and speed/direction]</p>

<p>9) SAR_U; 10) SAR_V; 11) SAR_W; 12) SAR_D; [SARWIND LG-Mod wind estimates, as U/V components and speed/direction]</p>

<p>Both REF_D and SAR_D are wind directions (expressed in degrees) with respect to the geographic North (0&deg;=North, 90&deg;=East, 180&deg;=South, 270&deg;=West), that the wind is blowing to.<br>
Both REF_W and SAR_W are wind speeds (expressed in m/s).<br>
Regarding REF_U/SAR_U and REF_V/SAR_V, note that a positive U component represents wind blowing to the East; a positive V component represents wind blowing to the North.</p>

<p>13) SceneCentre_TrueHeading_FF; [Mean angle formed between the geographical South-North direction and the SAR azimuth direction (wrt the centre of the SAR Full-Frame image)]</p>

<p>SceneCentre_TrueHeading_FF is a positive clockwise angle. In particular: SceneCentre_TrueHeading_FF is in ]180,360[ [deg].<br>
Thus:<br>
Descending Pass &lt;-&gt; &nbsp;SceneCentre_TrueHeading_FF is in ]180,270[ [deg]<br>
Ascending Pass &nbsp;&lt;-&gt; &nbsp;SceneCentre_TrueHeading_FF is in ]270,360[ [deg]</p>

<p>14) ROI_Npoints_UnUsablePointsMasked; [Number of samples used for each SARWIND LG-Mod wind estimation]</p>

<p>15) MeanIncAng; 16) MeanNRCS; [Mean incident angle (expressed in degrees) and NRCS of the ROI]</p>

<p>17) MeanResultantLength; 18) Alpha2_Est; [Fisher&#39;s formula parameters]</p>

<p>19) MEdeg [Margin of Error, i.e. accuracy of each wind direction estimate, between 0&deg; and 45&deg;]</p>

<p>The accuracy MEdeg is given by the semi-width of the confidence interval, with a confidence level (1-&alpha;) fixed, which is assigned to the wind direction estimate. Consequently, lower MEdeg values correspond to better estimates. And, if MEdeg == 45&deg;, wind estimates must be discharged.</p>

<p><br>
Finally, note also that you can cut an entire row when [SAR_U SAR_V SAR_W SAR_D] == [NaN NaN NaN NaN] (typically, this happens for &#39;land pixels&#39;).</p>

10.5061/dryad.sk81k,open,"Data from: Towards a self-updating platform for estimating rates of speciation and migration, ages, and relationships of taxa","Rapidly growing biological data –including molecular sequences and fossils– hold an unprecedented potential to reveal how evolutionary processes generate and maintain biodiversity. However, researchers often have to develop their own idiosyncratic workflows to integrate and analyse these data for reconstructing time-calibrated phylogenies. In addition, divergence times estimated under different methods and assumptions, and based on data of various quality and reliability, should not be combined without proper correction. Here we introduce a modular framework termed SUPERSMART (Self-Updating Platform for Estimating Rates of Speciation and Migration, Ages, and Relationships of Taxa), and provide a proof of concept for dealing with the moving targets of evolutionary and biogeographical research. This framework assembles comprehensive datasets of molecular and fossil data for any taxa and infers dated phylogenies using robust species tree methods, also allowing for the inclusion of genomic data produced through next-generation sequencing techniques. We exemplify the application of our method by presenting phylogenetic and dating analyses for the mammal order Primates and for the plant family Arecaceae (palms). We believe that this framework will provide a valuable tool for a wide range of hypothesis-driven research questions in systematics, biogeography, and evolution. SUPERSMART will also accelerate the inference of a ""Dated Tree of Life"" where all node ages are directly comparable."

<p><strong>Known bugs and limitations in this dataset or the associated manuscript.</strong></p>

<p>The confluence of the Missouri River and the Upper Mississippi River upstream of Saint Louis, MO was overlooked.&nbsp; The contribution from the Missouri River is therefore not accounted for in the network connectivity corresponding to the Upper Mississippi River Basin.&nbsp; This has no effect on the conclusions of David et al. (2011) since the Upper Mississippi River Basin was studied with synthetic data and solely to evaluate parallel performance of RAPID.</p>

10.5061/dryad.8cz8w9gnk,open,Data from: Ocean acidification induces subtle shifts in gene expression and DNA methylation in mantle tissue of the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica),"<p><b><span>Early evidence suggests that DNA methylation can mediate phenotypic responses of marine calcifying species to ocean acidification (OA). Few studies, however, have explicitly studied DNA methylation in calcifying tissues through time. Here, we examined the phenotypic and molecular responses in the extrapallial fluid and mantle (fluid and tissue at the calcification site) in adult eastern oyster (</span><span>Crassostrea virginica</span><span>) exposed to experimental OA over 80 days. Oysters were reared under three experimental </span><span>p</span><span>CO</span><span><span>2</span></span><span> treatments ('control', 580 μatm; 'moderate OA', 1000 μatm; 'high OA', 2800 μatm) and sampled at 6 time points (24 hours - 80 days). We found that high OA initially induced an increase in the pH of the extrapallial fluid (pH</span><span><span>EPF</span></span><span>) relative to the external seawater that peaked at day 9, but then diminished over time. Calcification rates were significantly lower in the high OA treatment compared to the other treatments. To explore how oysters regulate their extrapallial fluid, gene expression and DNA methylation were examined in the mantle-edge tissue of oysters from days 9 and 80 in the control and high OA treatments. Mantle tissue mounted a significant global molecular response (both in the transcriptome and methylome) to OA that shifted through time. Although we did not find individual genes that were significantly differentially expressed under OA, the pH</span><span><span>EPF</span></span><span> was significantly correlated with the eigengene expression of several co-expressed gene clusters. A small number of OA-induced differentially methylated loci were discovered, which corresponded with a weak association between OA-induced changes in genome-wide gene body DNA methylation and gene expression.</span><span> </span><span>Gene body methylation, however, was not significantly correlated with the eigengene expression of pH</span><span><span>EPF</span></span><span>-correlated gene clusters. These results suggest that OA induces a subtle response in a large number of genes in </span><span>C. virginica</span><span>, but also indicate that plasticity at the molecular level may be limited. Our study highlights the need to reassess our understanding of tissue-specific molecular responses in marine calcifiers</span><span>, </span><span>as well as the role of DNA methylation and gene expression in mediating physiological and biomineralization responses to OA. </span></b></p>"
